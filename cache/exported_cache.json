    "title": "A kinetic mechanism for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors based on multiple allosteric transitions.",
    "synopsis": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are transmembrane oligomeric proteins that mediate interconversions between open and closed channel states under the control of neurotransmitters. Fast in vitro chemical kinetics and in vivo electrophysiological recordings are consistent with the following multi-step scheme. Upon binding of agonists, receptor molecules in the closed but activatable resting state (the Basal state, B) undergo rapid transitions to states of higher affinities with either open channels (the Active state, A) or closed channels (the initial Inactivatable and fully Desensitized states, I and D). In order to represent the functional properties of such receptors, we have developed a kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the position of the interconversion transition states on a hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the model to the peripheral nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including single-channel events, and several new relationships are predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced previously. According to the model, recovery from the desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the standard 'cycle' model. Transitions to the desensitized states by low concentration 'pre-pulses' are predicted to occur without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times. Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and their possible role in coincidence detection. In terms of future developments, the analysis presented here provides a physical basis for constructing more biologically realistic models of synaptic modulation that may be applied to artificial neural networks.",

    "synopsis": "A central event in the eukaryotic cell cycle is the decision to commence DNA replication (S phase). Strict controls normally operate to prevent repeated rounds of DNA replication without intervening mitoses (\"endoreplication\") or initiation of mitosis before DNA is fully replicated (\"mitotic catastrophe\"). Some of the genetic interactions involved in these controls have recently been identified in yeast. From this evidence we propose a molecular mechanism of \"Start\" control in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using established principles of biochemical kinetics, we compare the properties of this model in detail with the observed behavior of various mutant strains of fission yeast: wee1(-) (size control at Start), cdc13Delta and rum1(OP) (endoreplication), and wee1(-) rum1Delta (rapid division cycles of diminishing cell size). We discuss essential features of the mechanism that are responsible for characteristic properties of Start control in fission yeast, to expose our proposal to crucial experimental tests.",

    "synopsis": "We demonstrate, by using mathematical modeling of cell division cycle (CDC) dynamics, a potential mechanism for precisely controlling the frequency of cell division and regulating the size of a dividing cell. Control of the cell cycle is achieved by artificially expressing a protein that reversibly binds and inactivates any one of the CDC proteins. In the simplest case, such as the checkpoint-free situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, the frequency of CDC oscillations can be increased or decreased by regulating the rate of synthesis, the binding rate, or the equilibrium constant of the binding protein. In a more complex model of cell division, where size-control checkpoints are included, we show that the same reversible binding reaction can alter the mean cell mass in a continuously dividing cell. Because this control scheme is general and requires only the expression of a single protein, it provides a practical means for tuning the characteristics of the cell cycle in vivo.",

Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.",

    "synopsis": "Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100% of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.",

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.",

    "synopsis": "Experimental and clinical data on purine metabolism are collated and analyzed with three mathematical models. The first model is the result of an attempt to construct a traditional kinetic model based on Michaelis-Menten rate laws. This attempt is only partially successful, since kinetic information, while extensive, is not complete, and since qualitative information is difficult to incorporate into this type of model. The data gaps necessitate the complementation of the Michaelis-Menten model with other functional forms that can incorporate different types of data. The most convenient and established representations for this purpose are rate laws formulated as power-law functions, and these are used to construct a Complemented Michaelis-Menten (CMM) model. The other two models are pure power-law-representations, one in the form of a Generalized Mass Action (GMA) system, and the other one in the form of an S-system. The first part of the paper contains a compendium of experimental data necessary for any model of purine metabolism. This is followed by the formulation of the three models and a comparative analysis. For physiological and moderately pathological perturbations in metabolites or enzymes, the results of the three models are very similar and consistent with clinical findings. This is an encouraging result since the three models have different structures and data requirements and are based on different mathematical assumptions. Significant enzyme deficiencies are not so well modeled by the S-system model. The CMM model captures the dynamics better, but judging by comparisons with clinical observations, the best model in this case is the GMA model. The model results are discussed in some detail, along with advantages and disadvantages of each modeling strategy.",

Taking into account recent experimental observations, the model for the circadian clock is based on multiple phosphorylation of PER and on the negative feedback exerted by PER on the transcription of the period (per) gene. This minimal biochemical model provides a molecular basis for circadian oscillations of the limit cycle type. During oscillations, the peak in per mRNA precedes by several hours the peak in total PER protein. The results support the view that multiple PER phosphorylation introduces times delays which strengthen the capability of negative feedback to produce oscillations. The analysis shows that the rhythm only occurs in a range bounded by two critical values of the maximum rate of PER degradation. A similar result is obtained with respect to the rate of PER transport into the nucleus. The results suggest a tentative explanation for the altered period of per mutants, in terms of variations in the rate of PER degradation.",

In the more traditional genetic engineering approaches 'bottle-necks' are pinpointed using qualitative, intuitive approaches, but the alleviation of suspected 'rate-limiting' steps has not often been successful. Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and diacetyl, important flavour compounds. The model presented here (available at http://jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za/wcfs.html) showed that the enzymes with the greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself. Experiments confirmed the predictions of the model, i.e. knocking out lactate dehydrogenase and overexpressing NADH oxidase increased the flux through the acetolactate synthase branch from 0 to 75% of measured product formation rates.",

    "synopsis": "A mathematical description of polyglutamated folate kinetics for human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) has been formulated based upon experimental folate, methotrexate (MTX), purine, and pyrimidine pool sizes as well as reaction rate parameters obtained from intact MCF-7 cells and their enzyme isolates. The schema accounts for the interconversion of highly polyglutamated tetrahydrofolate, 5-methyl-FH4, 5-10-CH2FH4, dihydrofolate (FH2), 10-formyl-FH4 (FFH4), and 10-formyl-FH2 (FFH2), as well as formation and transport of the MTX polyglutamates. Inhibition mechanisms have been chosen to reproduce all observed non-, un-, and pure competition inhibition patterns. Steady state folate concentrations and thymidylate and purine synthesis rates in drug-free intact cells were used to determine normal folate Vmax values. The resulting average-cell folate model, examined for its ability to predict folate pool behavior following exposure to 1 microM MTX over 21 h, agreed well with the experiment, including a relative preservation of the FFH4 and CH2FH4 pools. The results depend strongly on thymidylate synthase (TS) reaction mechanism, especially the assumption that MTX di- and triglutamates inhibit TS synthesis as greatly in the intact cell as they do with purified enzyme. The effects of cell cycle dependence of TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were also examined by introducing G- to S-phase activity ratios of these enzymes into the model. For activity ratios down to at least 5%, cell population averaged folate pools were only slightly affected, while CH2FH4 pools in S-phase cells were reduced to as little as 10% of control values. Significantly, these folate pool dynamics were indicated to arise from both direct inhibition by MTX polyglutamates as well as inhibition by elevated levels of polyglutamated FH2 and FFH2.",

The model provides insight into signal-response relationships between the binding of EGF to its receptor at the cell surface and the activation of downstream proteins in the signaling cascade. It shows that EGF-induced responses are remarkably stable over a 100-fold range of ligand concentration and that the critical parameter in determining signal efficacy is the initial velocity of receptor activation. The predictions of the model agree well with experimental analysis of the effect of EGF on two downstream responses, phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and expression of the target gene, c-fos.",

    "synopsis": "In Drosophila, circadian oscillations in the levels of two proteins, PER and TIM, result from the negative feedback exerted by a PER-TIM complex on the expression of the per and tim genes which code for these two proteins. On the basis of these experimental observations, we have recently proposed a theoretical model for circadian oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins in Drosophila. Here we show that for constant environmental conditions this model is capable of generating autonomous chaotic oscillations. For other parameter values, the model can also display birhythmicity, i.e. the coexistence between two stable regimes of limit cycle oscillations. We analyse the occurrence of chaos and birhythmicity by means of bifurcation diagrams and locate the different domains of complex oscillatory behavior in parameter space. The relative smallness of these domains raises doubts as to the possible physiological significance of chaos and birhythmicity in regard to circadian rhythm generation. Beyond the particular context of circadian rhythms we discuss the results in the light of other mechanisms underlying chaos and birhythmicity in regulated biological systems.

    "synopsis": "A mechanism for generating circadian rhythms has been of major interest in recent years. After the discovery of per and tim, a model with a simple feedback loop involving per and tim has been proposed. However, it is recognized that the simple feedback model cannot account for phenotypes generated by various mutants. A recent report by Glossop, Lyons & Hardin [Science286, 766 (1999)] on Drosophila suggests involvement of another feedback loop by dClk that is interlocked with per-tim feedback loop. In order to examine whether interlocked feedback loops can be a basic mechanism for circadian rhythms, a mathematical model was created and examined. Through extensive simulation and mathematical analysis, it was revealed that the interlocked feedback model accounts for the observations that are not explained by the simple feedback model. Moreover, the interlocked feedback model has robust properties in oscillations.",

    "title": "Analysis of sucrose accumulation in the sugar cane culm on the basis of in vitro kinetic data.",
    "synopsis": "Sucrose accumulation in developing sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) is accompanied by a continuous synthesis and cleavage of sucrose in the storage tissues. Despite numerous studies, the factors affecting sucrose accumulation are still poorly understood, and no consistent pattern has emerged which pinpoints certain enzyme activities as important controlling steps. Here, we develop an approach based on pathway analysis and kinetic modelling to assess the biochemical control of sucrose accumulation and futile cycling in sugar cane. By using the concept of elementary flux modes, all possible routes of futile cycling of sucrose were enumerated in the metabolic system. The available kinetic data for the pathway enzymes were then collected and assembled in a kinetic model of sucrose accumulation in sugar cane culm tissue. Although no data were fitted, the model agreed well with independent experimental results: in no case was the difference between calculated and measured fluxes and concentrations greater than 2-fold. The model thus validated was then used to assess different enhancement strategies for increasing sucrose accumulation. First, the control coefficient of each enzyme in the system on futile cycling of sucrose was calculated. Secondly, the activities of those enzymes with the numerically largest control coefficients were varied over a 5-fold range to determine the effect on the degree of futile cycling, the conversion efficiency from hexoses into sucrose, and the net sucrose accumulation rate. In view of the modelling results, overexpression of the fructose or glucose transporter or the vacuolar sucrose import protein, as well as reduction of cytosolic neutral invertase levels, appear to be the most promising targets for genetic manipulation. This offers a more directed improvement strategy than cumbersome gene-by-gene manipulation. The kinetic model can be viewed and interrogated on the World Wide Web at http://jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za.",

    "synopsis": "A mathematical model for the intracellular circadian rhythm generator has been studied, based on a negative feedback of protein products on the transcription rate of their genes. The study is an attempt at examining minimal but biologically realistic requirements for a negative molecular feedback loop involving considerably faster reactions, to produce (slow) circadian oscillations. The model included mRNA and protein production and degradation, along with a negative feedback of the proteins upon mRNA production. The protein production process was described solely by its total duration and a nonlinear term, whereas also the feedback included nonlinear interactions among protein molecules. This system was found to produce robust oscillations in protein and mRNA levels over a wide range of parameter values. Oscillations were slow, with periods much longer than the time constants of any of the individual system parameters. Circadian oscillations were obtained for realistic values of the parameters. The system was readily entrainable to external periodic perturbations. Two distinct classes of phase response curves were found, viz. with or without a time domain within the circadian cycle in which external perturbations fail to induce a phase shift (\"dead zone\"). The delay and nonlinearity in the protein production and the cooperativity in the negative feedback (Hill coefficient) were for this model found to be necessary and sufficient to generate robust circadian oscillations. The similarities between model outcomes and empirical findings establish that circadian rhythmicity at the cellular level can plausibly emerge from interactions among molecular systems which are not in themselves rhythmic.",

    "synopsis": "Although several detailed models of molecular processes essential for circadian oscillations have been developed, their complexity makes intuitive understanding of the oscillation mechanism difficult. The goal of the present study was to reduce a previously developed, detailed model to a minimal representation of the transcriptional regulation essential for circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila. The reduced model contains only two differential equations, each with time delays. A negative feedback loop is included, in which PER protein represses per transcription by binding the dCLOCK transcription factor. A positive feedback loop is also included, in which dCLOCK indirectly enhances its own formation. The model simulated circadian oscillations, light entrainment, and a phase-response curve with qualitative similarities to experiment. Time delays were found to be essential for simulation of circadian oscillations with this model. To examine the robustness of the simplified model to fluctuations in molecule numbers, a stochastic variant was constructed. Robust circadian oscillations and entrainment to light pulses were simulated with fewer than 80 molecules of each gene product present on average. Circadian oscillations persisted when the positive feedback loop was removed. Moreover, elimination of positive feedback did not decrease the robustness of oscillations to stochastic fluctuations or to variations in parameter values. Such reduced models can aid understanding of the oscillation mechanisms in Drosophila and in other organisms in which feedback regulation of transcription may play an important role.",

We use methods of statistical mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling networks. A key difficulty with signaling models is that, while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these networks, many of the parameters required to describe their behavior remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. In particular, we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling proteins, each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling approach, we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call 'sloppiness.'",

    "synopsis": "A model of Drosophila circadian rhythm generation was developed to represent feedback loops based on transcriptional regulation of per, Clk (dclock), Pdp-1, and vri (vrille). The model postulates that histone acetylation kinetics make transcriptional activation a nonlinear function of [CLK]. Such a nonlinearity is essential to simulate robust circadian oscillations of transcription in our model and in previous models. Simulations suggest that two positive feedback loops involving Clk are not essential for oscillations, because oscillations of [PER] were preserved when Clk, vri, or Pdp-1 expression was fixed. However, eliminating positive feedback by fixing vri expression altered the oscillation period. Eliminating the negative feedback loop in which PER represses per expression abolished oscillations. Simulations of per or Clk null mutations, of per overexpression, and of vri, Clk, or Pdp-1 heterozygous null mutations altered model behavior in ways similar to experimental data. The model simulated a photic phase-response curve resembling experimental curves, and oscillations entrained to simulated light-dark cycles. Temperature compensation of oscillation period could be simulated if temperature elevation slowed PER nuclear entry or PER phosphorylation. The model makes experimental predictions, some of which could be tested in transgenic Drosophila.",

    "synopsis": "A wide range of organisms use circadian clocks to keep internal sense of daily time and regulate their behavior accordingly. Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these \"circuits\" at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. & Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267-268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.",

    "title": "A simple model of circadian rhythms based on dimerization and proteolysis of PER and TIM.",
    "synopsis": "Many organisms display rhythms of physiology and behavior that are entrained to the 24-h cycle of light and darkness prevailing on Earth. Under constant conditions of illumination and temperature, these internal biological rhythms persist with a period close to 1 day (\"circadian\"), but it is usually not exactly 24h. Recent discoveries have uncovered stunning similarities among the molecular circuitries of circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and bread molds. A consensus picture is coming into focus around two proteins (called PER and TIM in fruit flies), which dimerize and then inhibit transcription of their own genes. Although this picture seems to confirm a venerable model of circadian rhythms based on time-delayed negative feedback, we suggest that just as crucial to the circadian oscillator is a positive feedback loop based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization. These ideas can be expressed in simple mathematical form (phase plane portraits), and the model accounts naturally for several hallmarks of circadian rhythms, including temperature compensation and the per(L) mutant phenotype. In addition, the model suggests how an endogenous circadian oscillator could have evolved from a more primitive, light-activated switch.",

    "synopsis": "Mutants of Physarum polycephalum can be complemented by fusion of plasmodial cells followed by cytoplasmic mixing. Complementation between strains carrying different mutational defects in the sporulation control network may depend on the signaling state of the network components. We have previously suggested that time-resolved somatic complementation (TRSC) analysis with such mutants may be used to probe network architecture and dynamics. By computer simulation it is now shown how and under which conditions the regulatory hierarchy of genes can be determined experimentally. A kinetic model of the sporulation control network is developed, which is then used to demonstrate how the mechanisms of TRSC can be understood and simulated at the kinetic level. On the basis of theoretical considerations, experimental parameters that determine whether functional complementation of two mutations will occur are identified. It is also shown how gene dosage-effect relationships can be employed for network analysis. The theoretical framework provided may be used to systematically analyze network structure and dynamics through time-resolved somatic complementation studies. The conclusions drawn are of general relevance in that they do not depend on the validity of the model from which they were derived.",

    "synopsis": "The kinetic parameters in vitro of the components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) in enteric bacteria were collected. To address the issue of whether the behavior in vivo of the PTS can be understood in terms of these enzyme kinetics, a detailed kinetic model was constructed. Each overall phosphotransfer reaction was separated into two elementary reactions, the first entailing association of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor into a complex and the second entailing dissociation of the complex into dephosphorylated donor and phosphorylated acceptor. Literature data on the K(m) values and association constants of PTS proteins for their substrates, as well as equilibrium and rate constants for the overall phosphotransfer reactions, were related to the rate constants of the elementary steps in a set of equations; the rate constants could be calculated by solving these equations simultaneously. No kinetic parameters were fitted. As calculated by the model, the kinetic parameter values in vitro could describe experimental results in vivo when varying each of the PTS protein concentrations individually while keeping the other protein concentrations constant. Using the same kinetic constants, but adjusting the protein concentrations in the model to those present in cell-free extracts, the model could reproduce experiments in vitro analyzing the dependence of the flux on the total PTS protein concentration. For modeling conditions in vivo it was crucial that the PTS protein concentrations be implemented at their high in vivo values. The model suggests a new interpretation of results hitherto not understood; in vivo, the major fraction of the PTS proteins may exist as complexes with other PTS proteins or boundary metabolites, whereas in vitro, the fraction of complexed proteins is much smaller.",

    "title": "Complex calcium oscillations and the role of mitochondria and cytosolic proteins.",
    "synopsis": "Intracellular calcium oscillations, which are oscillatory changes of cytosolic calcium concentration in response to agonist stimulation, are experimentally well observed in various living cells. Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.",

The same trajectory is attained from other phase points and even from the point corresponding to steady state solution of the differential equations. The model appears to exhibit limit cycle behavior. By stiffly coupling the concentrations of two of the intermediates, the limit cycle model can be simplified to a system described by two independent variables; this coupled system is amenable to analysis by theoretical techniques already developed for such systems. \u00a91974 American Institute of Physics",

    "title": "Creatine kinase in energy metabolic signaling in muscle",
    "synopsis": "There has been much debate on the mechanism of regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis to balance ATP consumption during changing cardiac workloads. A key role of creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes in this regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and in intracellular energy transport had been proposed, but has in the mean time been disputed for many years. It was hypothesized that high-energy phosphoryl groups are obligatorily transferred via CK; this is termed the phosphocreatine shuttle. The other important role ascribed to the CK system is its ability to buffer ADP concentration in cytosol near sites of ATP hydrolysis.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the experiments to determine the role of CK had been done in the steady state, but recently the dynamic response of oxidative phosphorylation to quick changes in cytosolic ATP hydrolysis has been assessed at various levels of inhibition of CK. Steady state models of CK function in energy transfer existed but were unable to explain the dynamic response with CK inhibited.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to explain the mode of functioning of the CK system in heart, and in particular the role of different CK isoenzymes in the dynamic response to workload steps. For this purpose we used a mathematical model of cardiac muscle cell energy metabolism containing the kinetics of the key processes of energy production, consumption and transfer pathways. The model underscores that CK plays indeed a dual role in the cardiac cells. The buffering role of CK system is due to the activity of myofibrillar CK (MMCK) while the energy transfer role depends on the activity of mitochondrial CK (MiCK). We propose that this may lead to the differences in regulation mechanisms and energy transfer modes in species with relatively low MiCK activity such as rabbit in comparison with species with high MiCK activity such as rat.\r\n\r\nThe model needed modification to explain the new type of experimental data on the dynamic response of the mitochondria. We submit that building a Virtual Muscle Cell is not possible without continuous experimental tests to improve the model. In close interaction with experiments we are developing a model for muscle energy metabolism and transport mediated by the creatine kinase isoforms which now already can explain many different types of experiments.",

    "synopsis": "The peroxidase-oxidase reaction is known to involve reactive oxygen species as intermediates. These intermediates inactivate many types of biomolecules, including peroxidase itself. Previously, we have shown that oscillatory dynamics in the peroxidase-oxidase reaction seem to protect the enzyme from inactivation. It was suggested that this is due to a lower average concentration of reactive oxygen species in the oscillatory state compared to the steady state. Here, we studied the peroxidase-oxidase reaction with either 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or melatonin as cofactors. We show that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is present in both cases. We also found that the enzyme degradation depends on the concentration of the cofactor and on the pH of the reaction mixture. We simulated the oscillatory behaviour, including the oscillation/steady state bistability observed experimentally, using a detailed reaction scheme. The computational results confirm the hypothesis that protection is due to lower average concentrations of superoxide radical during oscillations. They also show that the shape of the oscillations changes with increasing cofactor concentration resulting in a further decrease in the average concentration of radicals. We therefore hypothesize that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is a general effect in this system.",

    "synopsis": "During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.",

These ERK dynamics depend on Ras and Rap1 dynamics, the inactivation processes of which are growth-factor-dependent and -independent, respectively.

The measured responses were DFG, 3-deoxyosone, 1-deoxyosone, methylglyoxal, acetic acid, formic acid, glucose, fructose, mannose and melanoidins. For each system the model parameters, the rate constants, were estimated by non-linear regression, via multiresponse modelling. The determinant criterion was used as the statistical fit criterion. Model discrimination was performed by both chemical insight and statistical tests (Posterior Probability and Akaike criterion). Kinetic analysis showed that at lower pH DFG 1,2-enolization is favoured whereas with increasing pH 2,3-enolization becomes a more relevant degradation pathway. The lower amount observed of 1-DG is related with its high reactivity. It was shown that acetic acid, a main degradation product from DFG, was mainly formed through 1-DG degradation. Also from the estimated parameters 3-DG was found to be the main precursor in carbohydrate fragments formation, responsible for colour formation. Some indication was given that as the reaction proceeded other compounds besides DFG become reactants themselves with the formation among others of methylglyoxal. The multiresponse kinetic analysis was shown to be both helpful in deriving relevant kinetic parameters as well as in obtaining insight into the reaction mechanism.",

The determinant criterion was used as the statistical fit criterion instead of the familiar least squares to avoid statistical problems. The kinetic model was extensively tested by varying the reaction conditions. Different sugars (glucose, fructose, galactose, and tagatose) were studied regarding their effect on the reaction kinetics. This study has shown the power of multiresponse modeling for the unraveling of complicated reaction routes as occur in the Maillard reaction. The iterative process of proposing a model, confronting it with experiments, and criticizing the model was passed through four times to arrive at a model that was largely consistent with all results obtained. A striking difference was found between aldose and ketose sugars as suggested by the modeling results: not the ketoses themselves but only their reaction products were found to be reactive in the Maillard reaction.",

    "synopsis": "The Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino groups of biomolecules generates complex structures known as AGEs (advanced glycation endproducts). These have been linked to protein modifications found during aging, diabetes and various amyloidoses. To investigate the contribution of alternative routes to the formation of AGEs, we developed a mathematical model that describes the generation of CML [ N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine] in the Maillard reaction between glucose and collagen. Parameter values were obtained by fitting published data from kinetic experiments of Amadori compound decomposition and glycoxidation of collagen by glucose. These raw parameter values were subsequently fine-tuned with adjustment factors that were deduced from dynamic experiments taking into account the glucose and phosphate buffer concentrations. The fine-tuned model was used to assess the relative contributions of the reaction between glyoxal and lysine, the Namiki pathway, and Amadori compound degradation to the generation of CML. The model suggests that the glyoxal route dominates, except at low phosphate and high glucose concentrations. The contribution of Amadori oxidation is generally the least significant at low glucose concentrations. Simulations of the inhibition of CML generation by aminoguanidine show that this compound effectively blocks the glyoxal route at low glucose concentrations (5 mM). Model results are compared with literature estimates of the contributions to CML generation by the three pathways. The significance of the dominance of the glyoxal route is discussed in the context of possible natural defensive mechanisms and pharmacological interventions with the goal of inhibiting the Maillard reaction in vivo.",

    "synopsis": "A simplified mathematical model of cell metabolism describing ion pump, glycolysis and adenylate metabolism was developed and investigated in order to clarify the functional role of the adenylate metabolism system in human erythrocytes. The adenylate metabolism system was shown to be able to function as a specific regulatory system stabilizing intracellular ion concentration and, hence, erythrocyte volume under changes in the permeability of cell membrane. This stabilization is provided via an increase in adenylate pool in association with ATPases rate elevation. Proper regulation of adenylate pool size might be achieved even in the case when AMP synthesis rate remains constant and only AMP degradation rate varies. The best stabilization of intracellular ion concentration in the model is attained when the rate of AMP destruction is directly proportional to ATP concentration and is inversely proportional to AMP concentration. An optimal rate of adenylate metabolism in erythrocytes ranges from several tenths of a percent to several percent of the glycolytic flux. An increase in this rate results in deterioration of cell metabolism stability. Decrease in the rate of adenylate metabolism makes the functioning of this metabolic system inefficient, because the time necessary to achieve stabilization of intracellular ion concentration becomes comparable with erythrocyte life span.",

We develop an extended model that is based upon a wider range of data and accurately predicts additional experimental results. The model comprises interlocking feedback loops comparable to those identified experimentally in other circadian systems. We propose that each loop receives input signals from light, and that each loop includes a hypothetical component that had not been explicitly identified. Analysis of the model predicted the properties of these components, including an acute light induction at dawn that is rapidly repressed by LHY and CCA1. We found this unexpected regulation in RNA levels of the evening-expressed gene GIGANTEA (GI), supporting our proposed network and making GI a strong candidate for this component.",

Mathematical modeling, based on biochemical rate equations, provides a rigorous and reliable tool for unraveling the complexities of molecular regulatory networks. The budding yeast cell cycle is a challenging test case for this approach, because the control system is known in exquisite detail and its function is constrained by the phenotypic properties of >100 genetically engineered strains. We show that a mathematical model built on a consensus picture of this control system is largely successful in explaining the phenotypes of mutants described so far. A few inconsistencies between the model and experiments indicate aspects of the mechanism that require revision. In addition, the model allows one to frame and critique hypotheses about how the division cycle is regulated in wild-type and mutant cells, to predict the phenotypes of new mutant combinations, and to estimate the effective values of biochemical rate constants that are difficult to measure directly in vivo.",

We construct a model of the IP(3) receptor and fit the model to dynamic and steady-state experimental data from type-2 IP(3) receptors. Our results indicate that, (i) Ca(2+) binds to the receptor using saturating, not mass-action, kinetics; (ii) Ca(2+) decreases the rate of IP(3) binding while simultaneously increasing the steady-state sensitivity of the receptor to IP(3); (iii) the rate of Ca(2+)-induced receptor activation increases with Ca(2+) and is faster than Ca(2+)-induced receptor inactivation; and (iv) IP(3) receptors are sequentially activated and inactivated by Ca(2+) even when IP(3) is bound.

Such oscillations are believed to underlie oscillatory intercellular calcium waves in some cell types, and thus it is important to understand how they occur and are modified by intercellular coupling. Using a previous model of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells, this article explores the effects of coupling two cells with a simple linear diffusion term. Depending on the concentration of a signal molecule, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, coupling two identical cells by diffusion can give rise to synchronized in-phase oscillations, as well as different-amplitude in-phase oscillations and same-amplitude antiphase oscillations. Coupling two nonidentical cells leads to more complex behaviors such as cascades of period doubling and multiply periodic solutions. This study is a first step towards understanding the role and significance of the diffusion of calcium through gap junctions in the coordination of oscillatory calcium waves in a variety of cell types.

This model is coupled to equations describing Ca2+, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), ATP, and Na+ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In our model, metabolically derived ATP activates inward Ca2+ flux by regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and depolarization of the plasma membrane. Results from the simulations support the hypothesis that intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ in the ER can be the main variables driving both fast (2-7 osc/min) and slow intracellular Ca2+ concentration oscillations (0.3-0.9 osc/min) and that the effect of IP3 on Ca2+ leak from the ER contributes to the pattern of slow calcium oscillations. Simulations also show that filling the ER Ca2+ stores leads to faster electrical bursting and Ca2+ oscillations. Specific Ca2+ oscillations in isolated beta-cell lines can also be simulated.",

    "synopsis": "A simplified mechanism that mimics \"adaptation\" of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) has been developed and its significance for Ca2+(-)induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+ oscillations investigated. For parameters that reproduce experimental data for the RyR from cardiac cells, adaptation of the RyR in combination with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase Ca2+ pumps in the internal stores can give rise to either low [Cai2+] steady states or Ca2+ oscillations coexisting with unphysiologically high [Cai2+] steady states. In this closed-cell-type model rapid, adaptation-dependent Ca2+ oscillations occur only in limited ranges of parameters. In the presence of Ca2+ influx and efflux from outside the cell (open-cell model) Ca2+ oscillations occur for a wide range of physiological parameter values and have a period that is determined by the rate of Ca2+ refilling of the stores. Although the rate of adaptation of the RyR has a role in determining the shape and the period of the Ca2+ spike, it is not essential for their existence. This is in marked contrast with what is observed for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor for which the biphasic activation and inhibition of its activity by Ca2+ are sufficient to produce oscillations. Results for this model are compared with those based on Ca2+(-)induced Ca2+ release alone in the bullfrog sympathetic neuron. This kinetic model should be suitable for analyzing phenomena associated with \"Ca2+ sparks,\" including their merger into Ca2+ waves in cardiac myocytes.",

Using this direct approach, we fit a comprehensive model of glycolysis and glycolytic oscillations in intact yeast cells to data measured on a suspension of living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae near a Hopf bifurcation, and to a large set of stationary concentrations and other data estimated from comparable batch experiments.

Dynamic behavior of the trp operon corresponding to varying levels of extracellular tryptophan illustrates the adaptive nature of regulation. Depending on the external tryptophan level in the medium, the transient response ranges from a rapid and underdamped to a sluggish and highly overdamped response. To test model fidelity, simulation results are compared with experimental data available in the literature.

Intracellular concentrations of substrates and effectors for most key pathway enzymes were estimated from in vivo phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. These data show the validity in vivo of kinetic models previously proposed for phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase based on in vitro studies. Kinetic representations of hexokinase, glycogen synthetase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which incorporate major regulatory properties of these enzymes, are all consistent with the in vivo data. This detailed model of pathway kinetics and these data on intracellular metabolite concentrations allow evaluation of flux-control coefficients for all key enzymes involved in glucose catabolism under the four different cell environments examined. This analysis indicates that alginate entrapment increases the glucose uptake rate and shifts the step most influencing ethanol production from glucose uptake to phosphofructokinase. The rate of ATP utilization in these nongrowing cells strongly limits ethanol production at pH 5.5 but is relatively insignificant at pH 4.5.",

Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2.

In all three cases we find excellent agreement between the data and the model predictions.

    "synopsis": "A computer simulation of the threonine-synthesis pathway in Escherichia coli Tir-8 has been developed based on our previous measurements of the kinetics of the pathway enzymes under near-physiological conditions. The model successfully simulates the main features of the time courses of threonine synthesis previously observed in a cell-free extract without alteration of the experimentally determined parameters, although improved quantitative fits can be obtained with small parameter adjustments. At the concentrations of enzymes, precursors and products present in cells, the model predicts a threonine-synthesis flux close to that required to support cell growth. Furthermore, the first two enzymes operate close to equilibrium, providing an example of a near-equilibrium feedback-inhibited enzyme. The predicted flux control coefficients of the pathway enzymes under physiological conditions show that the control of flux is shared between the first three enzymes: aspartate kinase, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and homoserine dehydrogenase, with no single activity dominating the control. The response of the model to the external metabolites shows that the sharing of control between the three enzymes holds across a wide range of conditions, but that the pathway flux is sensitive to the aspartate concentration. When the model was embedded in a larger model to simulate the variable demands for threonine at different growth rates, it showed the accumulation of free threonine that is typical of the Tir-8 strain at low growth rates. At low growth rates, the control of threonine flux remains largely with the pathway enzymes. As an example of the predictive power of the model, we studied the consequences of over-expressing different enzymes in the pathway.",

In addition, de novo designed oscillators have been demonstrated, using components that are not part of the natural oscillators. Such oscillators are useful in testing the design principles and in exploring potential applications not limited by natural cellular behaviour. To achieve transcriptional and metabolic integration characteristic of natural oscillators, here we designed and constructed a synthetic circuit in Escherichia coli K12, using glycolytic flux to generate oscillation through the signalling metabolite acetyl phosphate. If two metabolite pools are interconverted by two enzymes that are placed under the transcriptional control of acetyl phosphate, the system oscillates when the glycolytic rate exceeds a critical value. We used bifurcation analysis to identify the boundaries of oscillation, and verified these experimentally. This work demonstrates the possibility of using metabolic flux as a control factor in system-wide oscillation, as well as the predictability of a de novo gene-metabolic circuit designed using nonlinear dynamic analysis.",

    "synopsis": "This work proposes a model of the metabolic branch-point between the methionine and threonine biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana which involves kinetic competition for phosphohomoserine between the allosteric enzyme threonine synthase and the two-substrate enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase. Threonine synthase is activated by S-adenosylmethionine and inhibited by AMP. Cystathionine gamma-synthase condenses phosphohomoserine to cysteine via a ping-pong mechanism. Reactions are irreversible and inhibited by inorganic phosphate. The modelling procedure included an examination of the kinetic links, the determination of the operating conditions in chloroplasts and the establishment of a computer model using the enzyme rate equations. To test the model, the branch-point was reconstituted with purified enzymes. The computer model showed a partial agreement with the in vitro results. The model was subsequently improved and was then found consistent with flux partition in vitro and in vivo. Under near physiological conditions, S-adenosylmethionine, but not AMP, modulates the partition of a steady-state flux of phosphohomoserine. The computer model indicates a high sensitivity of cystathionine flux to enzyme and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. Cystathionine flux is sensitive to modulation of threonine flux whereas the reverse is not true. The cystathionine gamma-synthase kinetic mechanism favours a low sensitivity of the fluxes to cysteine. Though sensitivity to inorganic phosphate is low, its concentration conditions the dynamics of the system. Threonine synthase and cystathionine gamma-synthase display similar kinetic efficiencies in the metabolic context considered and are first-order for the phosphohomoserine substrate. Under these conditions outflows are coordinated.",

    "synopsis": "MOTIVATION: The protein tyrosine kinase Src is involved in a multitude of biochemical pathways and cellular functions. A complex network of interactions with other kinases and phosphatases obscures its precise mode of operation. RESULTS: We have constructed a semi-quantitative computational dynamic systems model of the activation of Src at mitosis based on protein interactions described in the literature. Through numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis we show that Src regulation involves a bistable switch, a pattern increasingly recognised as essential to biochemical signalling. The switch is operated by the tyrosine kinase CSK, which itself is involved in a negative feedback loop with Src. Negative feedback generates an excitable system, which produces transient activation of Src. One of the system parameters, which is linked to the cyclin dependent kinase cdc2, controls excitability via a second bistable switch. This topology allows for differentiated responses to a multitude of signals. The model offers explanations for the existence of the positive and negative feedback loops involving protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) and translocation of CSK and predicts a specific relationship between Src phosphorylation and activity.",

    "title": "The principle of flux minimization and its application to estimate stationary fluxes in metabolic networks.",
    "synopsis": "Cellular functions are ultimately linked to metabolic fluxes brought about by thousands of chemical reactions and transport processes. The synthesis of the underlying enzymes and membrane transporters causes the cell a certain 'effort' of energy and external resources. Considering that those cells should have had a selection advantage during natural evolution that enabled them to fulfil vital functions (such as growth, defence against toxic compounds, repair of DNA alterations, etc.) with minimal effort, one may postulate the principle of flux minimization, as follows: given the available external substrates and given a set of functionally important 'target' fluxes required to accomplish a specific pattern of cellular functions, the stationary metabolic fluxes have to become a minimum. To convert this principle into a mathematical method enabling the prediction of stationary metabolic fluxes, the total flux in the network is measured by a weighted linear combination of all individual fluxes whereby the thermodynamic equilibrium constants are used as weighting factors, i.e. the more the thermodynamic equilibrium lies on the right-hand side of the reaction, the larger the weighting factor for the backward reaction. A linear programming technique is applied to minimize the total flux at fixed values of the target fluxes and under the constraint of flux balance (= steady-state conditions) with respect to all metabolites. The theoretical concept is applied to two metabolic schemes: the energy and redox metabolism of erythrocytes, and the central metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The flux rates predicted by the flux-minimization method exhibit significant correlations with flux rates obtained by either kinetic modelling or direct experimental determination. Larger deviations occur for segments of the network composed of redundant branches where the flux-minimization method always attributes the total flux to the thermodynamically most favourable branch. Nevertheless, compared with existing methods of structural modelling, the principle of flux minimization appears to be a promising theoretical approach to assess stationary flux rates in metabolic systems in cases where a detailed kinetic model is not yet available.",

    "synopsis": "Kinetoplastid protozoa compartmentalize the first seven enzymes of glycolysis and two enzymes of glycerol metabolism in a microbody, the glycosome. While in its mammalian host, Trypanosoma brucei depends entirely on glucose for ATP generation. Under aerobic conditions, most of the glucose is metabolized to pyruvate. Aerobic metabolism depends on the activities of glycosomal triosephosphate isomerase and a mitochondrial glycerophosphate oxidase, and on glycerophosphate<-->dihydroxyacetone phosphate exchange across the glycosomal membrane. Using a combination of genetics and computer modelling, we show that triosephosphate isomerase is probably essential for bloodstream trypanosome survival, but not for the insect-dwelling procyclics, which preferentially use amino acids as an energy source. When the enzyme level decreased to about 15% of that of the wild-type, the growth rate was halved. Below this level, a lethal rise in dihydroxyacetone phosphate was predicted. Expression of cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase inhibited cell growth. Attempts to knockout the trypanosome alternative oxidase genes (which are needed for glycerophosphate oxidase activity) were unsuccessful, but when we lowered the level of the corresponding mRNA by expressing a homologous double-stranded RNA, oxygen consumption was reduced fourfold and the rate of trypanosome growth was halved.",

We have quantitatively characterized the heterotrimeric G protein cycle in yeast based on direct in vivo measurements. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the association state of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-Galpha and Gbetagamma-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and we found that receptor-mediated G protein activation produced a loss of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Quantitative time course and dose-response data were obtained for both wild-type and mutant cells possessing an altered pheromone response. These results paint a quantitative portrait of how regulators such as Sst2p and the C-terminal tail of alpha-factor receptor modulate the kinetics and sensitivity of G protein signaling. We have explored critical features of the dynamics including the rapid rise and subsequent decline of active G proteins during the early response, and the relationship between the G protein activation dose-response curve and the downstream dose-response curves for cell-cycle arrest and transcriptional induction. Fitting the data to a mathematical model produced estimates of the in vivo rates of heterotrimeric G protein activation and deactivation in yeast.",

    "synopsis": "We studied the bradykinin-induced changes in phosphoinositide composition of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells using a combination of biochemistry, microscope imaging, and mathematical modeling. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) decreased over the first 30 s, and then recovered over the following 2-3 min. However, the rate and amount of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) production were much greater than the rate or amount of PIP2 decline. A mathematical model of phosphoinositide turnover based on this data predicted that PIP2 synthesis is also stimulated by bradykinin, causing an early transient increase in its concentration. This was subsequently confirmed experimentally. Then, we used single-cell microscopy to further examine phosphoinositide turnover by following the translocation of the pleckstrin homology domain of PLCdelta1 fused to green fluorescent protein (PH-GFP). The observed time course could be simulated by incorporating binding of PIP2 and InsP3 to PH-GFP into the model that had been used to analyze the biochemistry. Furthermore, this analysis could help to resolve a controversy over whether the translocation of PH-GFP from membrane to cytosol is due to a decrease in PIP2 on the membrane or an increase in InsP3 in cytosol; by computationally clamping the concentrations of each of these compounds, the model shows how both contribute to the dynamics of probe translocation.",

    "synopsis": "Glycerol, a major by-product of ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is of significant importance to the wine, beer, and ethanol production industries. To gain a clearer understanding of and to quantify the extent to which parameters of the pathway affect glycerol flux in S. cerevisiae, a kinetic model of the glycerol synthesis pathway has been constructed. Kinetic parameters were collected from published values. Maximal enzyme activities and intracellular effector concentrations were determined experimentally. The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (C(J)v1) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (R(J)DHAP= 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (R(J)ATP = -0.21 to -0.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (R(J)NADH = 0.03 to 0.08). The model indicates that the best strategy to increase flux through the pathway is not to increase enzyme activity, substrate concentration, or coenzyme concentration alone but to increase all of these parameters in conjunction with each other.",

    "synopsis": "The resolution to lose weight by cognitive restraint of nutritional intake often leads to repeated bouts of weight loss and regain, a phenomenon known as weight cycling or \"yo-yo dieting\". A simple mathematical model for weight cycling is presented. The model is based on a feedback of psychological nature by which a subject decides to reduce dietary intake once a threshold weight is exceeded. The analysis of the model indicates that sustained oscillations in body weight occur in a parameter range bounded by critical values. Only outside this range can body weight reach a stable steady state. The model provides a theoretical framework that captures key facets of weight cycling and suggests ways to control the phenomenon. The view that weight cycling represents self-sustained oscillations has indeed specific implications. In dynamical terms, to bring weight cycling to an end, parameter values should change in such a way as to induce the transition of body weight from sustained oscillations around an unstable steady state to a stable steady state. Maintaining weight under a critical value should prevent weight cycling and allow body weight to stabilize below the oscillatory range.",

    "synopsis": "Activation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase in the presence of GTP, the natural guanine nucleotide regulator, are too fast to study by standard biochemical methods. In order to identify the rate-limiting steps in adenylate cyclase regulation, we measured the kinetics of stimulation and inhibition of the enzyme on a subsecond to second time scale using a novel rapid-mix quench technique. Even using our rapid-mix quench method, activation by PGE1 and forskolin was instantaneous (cAMP accumulation was linear between 0.5 and 30 s). In contrast, we found a lag period of 1.2-10 s for epinephrine-mediated inhibition. The length of the lag depended on the concentration of GTP and monovalent cations present. In the absence of NaCl, the rate constant for the onset of inhibition (kinh) increased only slightly with GTP concentration saturating at a value of 0.16 s-1 (t1/2 4.3 s) at 1 microM GTP. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, kinh was strongly dependent on GTP concentration, reaching a maximum value of 0.57 s-1 (t1/2 1.2 s) at 100 microM GTP. Thus, activation of both Gi and Gs in intact platelet membranes is much faster (t1/2 less than 5 s) than previously reported for reconstituted systems. Also, the strong dependence of the rate of adenylate cyclase inhibition on GTP concentration implies that the rate-limiting step in inhibition is distal to GTP binding. The effect of NaCl to increase the maximal rate of inhibition is specific for sodium since KCl has no effect on kinh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "synopsis": "Receptor-mediated modulation of KCNQ channels regulates neuronal excitability. This study concerns the kinetics and mechanism of M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated regulation of the cloned neuronal M channel, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (Kv7.2/Kv7.3). Receptors, channels, various mutated G-protein subunits, and an optical probe for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were coexpressed by transfection in tsA-201 cells, and the cells were studied by whole-cell patch clamp and by confocal microscopy. Constitutively active forms of Galphaq and Galpha11, but not Galpha13, caused a loss of the plasma membrane PIP2 and a total tonic inhibition of the KCNQ current. There were no further changes upon addition of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M (oxo-M). Expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling, RGS2, blocked PIP2 hydrolysis and current suppression by muscarinic stimulation, confirming that the Gq family of G-proteins is necessary. Dialysis with the competitive inhibitor GDPbetaS (1 mM) lengthened the time constant of inhibition sixfold, decreased the suppression of current, and decreased agonist sensitivity. Removal of intracellular Mg2+ slowed both the development and the recovery from muscarinic suppression. When combined with GDPbetaS, low intracellular Mg2+ nearly eliminated muscarinic inhibition. With nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, current suppression developed spontaneously and muscarinic inhibition was enhanced. Such spontaneous suppression was antagonized by GDPbetaS or GTP or by expression of RGS2. These observations were successfully described by a kinetic model representing biochemical steps of the signaling cascade using published rate constants where available. The model supports the following sequence of events for this Gq-coupled signaling: A classical G-protein cycle, including competition for nucleotide-free G-protein by all nucleotide forms and an activation step requiring Mg2+, followed by G-protein-stimulated phospholipase C and hydrolysis of PIP2, and finally PIP2 dissociation from binding sites for inositol lipid on the channels so that KCNQ current was suppressed. Further experiments will be needed to refine some untested assumptions.",

    "synopsis": "The functional significance of high affinity agonist binding to receptors that interact with guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins has remained controversial. Preincubation of human platelet membranes with the full alpha 2-agonist UK 14,304 in the absence of GTP increases the potency of the agonist to inhibit adenylate cyclase in a pre-steady state (15-sec) assay. The EC50 after preincubation (6 +/- 1 nM) is within a factor of 2 of the high affinity Kd for [3H]UK 14,304 binding determined under identical conditions (2.7 +/- 0.1 nM). In contrast, in the usual steady state measurements (15 min) or in pre-steady state measurements without agonist preincubation, the EC50 values (74 +/- 1 and 207 +/- 8 nM, respectively) are near the low affinity Kd for [3H]UK 14,304 binding. Reduction of the GTP concentration in steady state adenylate cyclase assays also decreases the EC50 for UK 14,304 from 40 +/- 5 nM at 10 microM GTP to 14 +/- 5 nM with no added GTP. Both sets of experimental observations are accommodated by a complete kinetic model of inhibition in which the high affinity ternary complex of drug, receptor, and G protein leads to the response. Explicit rate parameters are included for agonist binding, receptor-G protein interactions, GTP binding, and hydrolysis. Despite the functional role of the high affinity state of the alpha 2-receptor in this model, the steady state EC50 for agonist-mediated inhibition correlates best with the Kd of low affinity agonist binding in the presence of high levels of GTP. Under conditions in which formation of the high affinity ternary complex is favored, the EC50 for responses approaches the high affinity Kd.",

    "synopsis": "General and simple principles are identified that govern signal transduction. The effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibition on a MAP kinase pathway are first examined in silico. Quantitative measures for the control of signal amplitude, duration and integral strength are introduced. We then identify and prove new principles, such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero, and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal -1. Collectively, kinases control amplitudes more than duration, whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude, in particular long after EGF administration. Implications for the cellular decision between growth and differentiation are discussed.",

    "synopsis": "Biochemical systems embed complex networks and hence development and analysis of their detailed models pose a challenge for computation. Coarse-grained biochemical models, called reduced-order models (ROMs), consisting of essential biochemical mechanisms are more useful for computational analysis and for studying important features of a biochemical network. The authors present a novel method to model-reduction by identifying potentially important parameters using multidimensional sensitivity analysis. A ROM is generated for the GTPase-cycle module of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, Gq, and regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (a GTPase-activating protein or GAP) starting from a detailed model of 48 reactions. The resulting ROM has only 17 reactions. The ROM suggested that complexes of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and GAP--which were proposed in the detailed model as a hypothesis--are required to fit the experimental data. Models previously published in the literature are also simulated and compared with the ROM. Through this comparison, a minimal ROM, that also requires complexes of GPCR and GAP, with just 15 parameters is generated. The proposed reduced-order modelling methodology is scalable to larger networks and provides a general framework for the reduction of models of biochemical systems.",

    "title": "Computational modeling reveals how interplay between components of a GTPase-cycle module regulates signal transduction.",
    "synopsis": "Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is regulated by signaling modules composed of heterotrimeric G proteins, active G protein-coupled receptors (Rs), which activate G proteins, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which deactivate G proteins. We term these modules GTPase-cycle modules. The local concentrations of these proteins are spatially regulated between plasma membrane microdomains and between the plasma membrane and cytosol, but no data or models are available that quantitatively explain the effect of such regulation on signaling. We present a computational model of the GTPase-cycle module that predicts that the interplay of local G protein, R, and GAP concentrations gives rise to 16 distinct signaling regimes and numerous intermediate signaling phenomena. The regimes suggest alternative modes of the GTPase-cycle module that occur based on defined local concentrations of the component proteins. In one mode, signaling occurs while G protein and receptor are unclustered and GAP eliminates signaling; in another, G protein and receptor are clustered and GAP can rapidly modulate signaling but does not eliminate it. Experimental data from multiple GTPase-cycle modules is interpreted in light of these predictions. The latter mode explains previously paradoxical data in which GAP does not alter maximal current amplitude of G protein-activated ion channels, but hastens signaling. The predictions indicate how variations in local concentrations of the component proteins create GTPase-cycle modules with distinctive phenotypes. They provide a quantitative framework for investigating how regulation of local concentrations of components of the GTPase-cycle module affects signaling.",

    "synopsis": "One of the DNA damage-response mechanisms in budding yeast is temporary cell-cycle arrest while DNA repair takes place. The DNA damage response requires the coordinated interaction between DNA repair and checkpoint pathways. Telomeres of budding yeast are capped by the Cdc13 complex. In the temperature-sensitive cdc13-1 strain, telomeres are unprotected over a specific temperature range leading to activation of the DNA damage response and subsequently cell-cycle arrest. Inactivation of cdc13-1 results in the generation of long regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is affected by the activity of various checkpoint proteins and nucleases. This paper describes a mathematical model of how uncapped telomeres in budding yeast initiate the checkpoint pathway leading to cell-cycle arrest. The model was encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and simulated using the stochastic simulation system Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation (BASIS). Each simulation follows the time course of one mother cell keeping track of the number of cell divisions, the level of activity of each of the checkpoint proteins, the activity of nucleases and the amount of ssDNA generated. The model can be used to carry out a variety of in silico experiments in which different genes are knocked out and the results of simulation are compared to experimental data. Possible extensions to the model are also discussed.",

    "synopsis": "Sustained contraction of cells depends on sustained Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) activation. We developed a computational model of the Rho-kinase pathway to understand the systems characteristics. Thrombin-dependent in vivo transient responses of Rho activation and Ca2+ increase could be reproduced in silico. Low and high thrombin stimulation induced transient and sustained phosphorylation, respectively, of myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) in vivo. The transient phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 could be reproduced in silico, but their sustained phosphorylation could not. This discrepancy between in vivo and in silico in the sustained responses downstream of Rho-kinase indicates that a missing pathway(s) may be responsible for the sustained Rho-kinase activation. We found, experimentally, that the sustained phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 exhibit all-or-none responses. Bromoenol lactone, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+ -independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), inhibited sustained phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1, which indicates that sustained Rho-kinase activation requires iPLA2 activity. Thus, the systems analysis of the Rho-kinase pathway identified a novel iPLA2-dependent mechanism of the sustained Rho-kinase activation, which exhibits an all-or-none response.",

Model predictions fit closely to new data on the gi;lhy;cca1 mutant, which confirm that GI is a major contributor to Y function.

    "title": "Modelling the actions of chaperones and their role in ageing.",
    "synopsis": "Many molecular chaperones are also known as heat shock proteins because they are synthesised in increased amounts after brief exposure of cells to elevated temperatures. They have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of nascent proteins, the re-folding of denatured proteins, the prevention of protein aggregation, and assisting the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and lysosomes. They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced transcription of heat shock proteins requires the activation of heat shock factor (HSF). Under normal conditions, HSF is bound to heat shock proteins resulting in feedback repression. During stress, cellular proteins undergo denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to HSF, which is then able to become transcriptionally active. The induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there is also a decline in chaperone function. Aberrant/damaged proteins accumulate with age and are implicated in several important age-related conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cataract). Therefore, the balance between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be greatly disturbed during ageing. We have developed a mathematical model to describe the heat shock system. The aim of the model is two-fold: to explore the heat shock system and its implications in ageing; and to demonstrate how to build a model of a biological system using our simulation system (biology of ageing e-science integration and simulation (BASIS)).",

    "synopsis": "In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. & Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. & Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.",

    "synopsis": "A network of interacting proteins has been found that can account for the spontaneous oscillations in adenylyl cyclase activity that are observed in homogenous populations of Dictyostelium cells 4 h after the initiation of development. Previous biochemical assays have shown that when extracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) binds to the surface receptor CAR1, adenylyl cyclase and the MAP kinase ERK2 are transiently activated. A rise in the internal concentration of cAMP activates protein kinase A such that it inhibits ERK2 and leads to a loss-of-ligand binding by CAR1. ERK2 phosphorylates the cAMP phosphodiesterase REG A that reduces the internal concentration of cAMP. A secreted phosphodiesterase reduces external cAMP concentrations between pulses. Numerical solutions to a series of nonlinear differential equations describing these activities faithfully account for the observed periodic changes in cAMP. The activity of each of the components is necessary for the network to generate oscillatory behavior; however, the model is robust in that 25-fold changes in the kinetic constants linking the activities have only minor effects on the predicted frequency. Moreover, constant high levels of external cAMP lead to attenuation, whereas a brief pulse of cAMP can advance or delay the phase such that interacting cells become entrained.",

    "synopsis": "Taking into account the Ca(2+)-stimulated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) by a 3-kinase, we have theoretically explored the effects of both simple and complex Ca(2+) oscillations on the regulation of a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle process involved in glycogen degradation by glycogen phosphorylase a-form, respectively. For the case of simple Ca(2+) oscillations, the roles of cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations in the regulation of active phosphorylase depend upon the maximum rate of IP(3) degradation by the 3-kinase, V(M5). In particular, the smaller the values of V(M5) are, the lower the effective Ca(2+) threshold for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase will be. For the case of complex Ca(2+) oscillations, the average level of fraction of active phosphorylase is nearly independent from the level of stimulation increasing in the bursting oscillatory domain. Both simple and complex Ca(2+) oscillations can contribute to increase the efficiency and specificity of cellular signalling, and some theoretical results of activation of glycogen phosphorylase regulated by Ca(2+) oscillations are close to the experimental results for gene expression in lymphocytes.",

It transduces a variety of extracellular signals into intracellular transcriptional responses that control a plethora of cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. We use computational modeling to show that coupling of signaling with receptor trafficking results in a highly versatile signal-processing unit, able to sense by itself absolute levels of ligand, temporal changes in ligand concentration, and ratios of multiple ligands. This coupling controls whether the response of the receptor module is transient or permanent and whether or not different signaling channels behave independently of each other. Our computational approach unifies seemingly disparate experimental observations and suggests specific changes in receptor trafficking patterns that can lead to phenotypes that favor tumor progression.",

    "synopsis": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as well as the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation.The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics.We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process.",

    "synopsis": "Drug molecules not only interact with specific targets, but also alter the state and function of the associated biological network. How to design drugs and evaluate their functions at the systems level becomes a key issue in highly efficient and low-side-effect drug design. The arachidonic acid metabolic network is the network that produces inflammatory mediators, in which several enzymes, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), have been used as targets for anti-inflammatory drugs. However, neither the century-old nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs nor the recently revocatory Vioxx have provided completely successful anti-inflammatory treatment. To gain more insights into the anti-inflammatory drug design, the authors have studied the dynamic properties of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network in human polymorphous leukocytes. Metabolic flux, exogenous AA effects, and drug efficacy have been analyzed using ordinary differential equations. The flux balance in the AA network was found to be important for efficient and safe drug design. When only the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor was used, the flux of the COX-2 pathway was increased significantly, showing that a single functional inhibitor cannot effectively control the production of inflammatory mediators. When both COX-2 and 5-LOX were blocked, the production of inflammatory mediators could be completely shut off. The authors have also investigated the differences between a dual-functional COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor and a mixture of these two types of inhibitors. Their work provides an example for the integration of systems biology and drug discovery.",

    "synopsis": "To contribute to a deeper understanding of M-phase control in eukaryotic cells, we have constructed a model based on the biochemistry of M-phase promoting factor (MPF) in Xenopus oocyte extracts, where there is evidence for two positive feedback loops (MPF stimulates its own production by activating Cdc25 and inhibiting Wee1) and a negative feedback loop (MPF stimulates its own destruction by indirectly activating the ubiquitin pathway that degrades its cyclin subunit). To uncover the full dynamical possibilities of the control system, we translate the regulatory network into a set of differential equations and study these equations by graphical techniques and computer simulation. The positive feedback loops in the model account for thresholds and time lags in cyclin-induced and MPF-induced activation of MPF, and the model can be fitted quantitatively to these experimental observations. The negative feedback loop is consistent with observed time lags in MPF-induced cyclin degradation. Furthermore, our model indicates that there are two possible mechanisms for autonomous oscillations. One is driven by the positive feedback loops, resulting in phosphorylation and abrupt dephosphorylation of the Cdc2 subunit at an inhibitory tyrosine residue. These oscillations are typical of oocyte extracts. The other type is driven by the negative feedback loop, involving rapid cyclin turnover and negligible phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of Cdc2. The early mitotic cycles of intact embryos exhibit such characteristics. In addition, by assuming that unreplicated DNA interferes with M-phase initiation by activating the phosphatases that oppose MPF in the positive feedback loops, we can simulate the effect of addition of sperm nuclei to oocyte extracts, and the lengthening of cycle times at the mid-blastula transition of intact embryos.",

    "synopsis": "One of the most important antioxidant enzymes is superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyses the dismutation of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme plays an important role in diseases like trisomy 21 and also in theories of the mechanisms of aging. But instead of being beneficial, intensified oxidative stress is associated with the increased expression of SOD and also studies on bacteria and transgenic animals show that high levels of SOD actually lead to increased lipid peroxidation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Using mathematical models we investigate the question how overexpression of SOD can lead to increased oxidative stress, although it is an antioxidant enzyme. We consider the following possibilities that have been proposed in the literature: (i) Reaction of H(2)O(2) with CuZnSOD leading to hydroxyl radical formation. (ii) Superoxide radicals might reduce membrane damage by acting as radical chain breaker. (iii) While detoxifying superoxide radicals SOD cycles between a reduced and oxidized state. At low superoxide levels the intermediates might interact with other redox partners and increase the superoxide reductase (SOR) activity of SOD. This short-circuiting of the SOD cycle could lead to an increased hydrogen peroxide production. We find that only one of the proposed mechanisms is under certain circumstances able to explain the increased oxidative stress caused by SOD. But furthermore we identified an additional mechanism that is of more general nature and might be a common basis for the experimental findings. We call it the alternative pathway mechanism.",

However, under constant growth factor stimulation, cells show constitutively active cyclin D:Cdk4/6 throughout the cell cycle and thereby exclude cyclin D:Cdk4/6 inactivation of pRb. To address this paradox, we developed a mathematical model of G(1) progression using physiological expression and activity profiles from synchronized cells exposed to constant growth factors and included a metabolically responsive, activating modifier of cyclin E:Cdk2. Our mathematical model accurately simulates G(1) progression, recapitulates observations from targeted gene deletion studies and serves as a foundation for development of therapeutics targeting G(1) cell-cycle progression.",

Can these molecular components be spun together into a consistent mechanism that accounts for the observed behavior of growth and division in fission yeast cells? To answer this question, we propose a mechanism for the control system, convert it into a set of 14 differential and algebraic equations, study these equations by numerical simulation and bifurcation theory, and compare our results to the physiology of wild-type and mutant cells. In wild-type cells, progress through the cell cycle (G1-->S-->G2-->M) is related to cyclic progression around a hysteresis loop, driven by cell growth and chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate. However, the control system operates much differently in double-mutant cells, wee1(-) cdc25Delta, which are defective in progress through the latter half of the cell cycle (G2 and M phases). These cells exhibit \"quantized\" cycles (interdivision times clustering around 90, 160, and 230 min). We show that these quantized cycles are associated with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the mechanism, when the wee1 and cdc25 genes are disabled. (c) 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

    "synopsis": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling is an important regulator of cellular growth and differentiation. The principal intracellular mediators of TGFbeta signalling are the Smad proteins, which upon TGFbeta stimulation accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes. To investigate the mechanisms of Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed a simple mathematical model of canonical Smad signalling. The model was built using both published data and our experimentally determined cellular Smad concentrations (isoforms 2, 3 and 4). We found in mink lung epithelial cells that Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)) was present in similar amounts to Smad4 (9.3-12 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)), whereas both were in excess of Smad3 (1.1-2.0 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)). Variation of the model parameters and statistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to parameters affecting the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and Smad complex formation/ dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the model revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an important mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed that binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently mediate Smad nuclear accumulation, if dephosphorylation is rapid. We therefore conclude that an imbalance in the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is likely an important mechanism of Smad nuclear accumulation during TGFbeta signalling.",

    "synopsis": "Given the ubiquitous nature of signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations, the question arises as to how cellular responses are affected by repetitive Ca2+ spikes. Among these responses, we focus on those involving protein phosphorylation. We examine, by numerical simulations of a theoretical model, the situation where a protein is phosphorylated by a Ca(2+)-activated kinase and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase. This reversible phosphorylation system is coupled to a mechanism generating cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations; for definiteness, this oscillatory mechanism is based on the process of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. The analysis shows that the average fraction of phosphorylated protein increases with the frequency of repetitive Ca2+ spikes; the latter frequency generally rises with the extent of external stimulation. Protein phosphorylation therefore provides a mechanism for the encoding of the external stimulation in terms of the frequency of signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Such a frequency encoding requires precise kinetic conditions on the Michaelis-Menten constants of the kinase and phosphatase, their maximal rates, and the degree of cooperativity in kinase activation by Ca2+. In particular, the most efficient encoding of Ca2+ oscillations based on protein phosphorylation occurs in conditions of zero-order ultrasensitivity, when the kinase and phosphatase are saturated by their protein substrate. The kinetic analysis uncovers a wide variety of temporal patterns of phosphorylation that could be driven by signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations.",

    "synopsis": "Cells must respond specifically to different environmental stimuli in order to survive. The signal transduction pathways involved in sensing these stimuli often share the same or homologous proteins. Despite potential cross-wiring, cells show specificity of response. We show, through modeling, that the physiological response of such pathways exposed to simultaneous and temporally ordered inputs can demonstrate system-level mechanisms by which pathways achieve specificity. We apply these results to the hyperosmolar and pheromone mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These two pathways specifically sense osmolar and pheromone signals, despite sharing a MAPKKK, Ste11, and having homologous MAPKs (Fus3 and Hog1). We show that in a single cell, the pathways are bistable over a range of inputs, and the cell responds to only one stimulus even when exposed to both. Our results imply that these pathways achieve specificity by filtering out spurious cross-talk through mutual inhibition. The variability between cells allows for heterogeneity of the decisions.",

    "title": "Signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations: properties of a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release.",
    "synopsis": "We consider a simple, minimal model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. The model takes into account the existence of two pools of intracellular Ca2+, namely, one sensitive to inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP3) whose synthesis is elicited by the stimulus, and one insensitive to InsP3. The discharge of the latter pool into the cytosol is activated by cytosolic Ca2+. Oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ arise in this model either spontaneously or in an appropriate range of external stimulation; these oscillations do not require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The following properties of the model are reviewed and compared with experimental observations: (a) Control of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations by the external stimulus or extracellular Ca2+; (b) correlation of latency with period of Ca2+ oscillations obtained at different levels of stimulation; (c) effect of a transient increase in InsP3; (d) phase shift and transient suppression of Ca2+ oscillations by Ca2+ pulses, and (e) propagation of Ca2+ waves. It is shown that on all these counts the model provides a simple, unified explanation for a number of experimental observations in a variety of cell types. The model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release can be extended to incorporate variations in the level of InsP3 as well as desensitization of the InsP3 receptor; besides accounting for the phenomena described by the minimal model, the extended model might also account for the occurrence of complex Ca2+ oscillations.",

    "synopsis": "The intrinsic firing modes of adult CA1 pyramidal cells vary along a continuum of \"burstiness\" from regular firing to rhythmic bursting, depending on the ionic composition of the extracellular milieu. Burstiness is low in neurons exposed to a normal extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)), but is markedly enhanced by lowering [Ca(2+)](o), although not by blocking Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents. We show, using intracellular recordings, that burstiness in low [Ca(2+)](o) persists even after truncating the apical dendrites, suggesting that bursts are generated by an interplay of membrane currents at or near the soma. To study the mechanisms of bursting, we have constructed a conductance-based, one-compartment model of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Increasing I(NaP) in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes within a burst but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis and bifurcation theory, that the M-type K(+) current (I(M)) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior between a silent and a tonically active state provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are sufficiently, although not extremely, fast.

    "synopsis": "The specificity and sensitivity of T-cell recognition is vital to the immune response. Ligand engagement with the T-cell receptor (TCR) results in the activation of a complex sequence of signalling events, both on the cell membrane and intracellularly. Feedback is an integral part of these signalling pathways, yet is often ignored in standard accounts of T-cell signalling. Here we show, using a mathematical model, that these feedback loops can explain the ability of the TCR to discriminate between ligands with high specificity and sensitivity, as well as provide a mechanism for sustained signalling. The model also explains the recent counter-intuitive observation that endogenous 'null' ligands can significantly enhance T-cell signalling. Finally, the model may provide an archetype for receptor switching based on kinase-phosphatase switches, and thus be of interest to the wider signalling community.",

    "synopsis": "A variety of mutations in HERG, the major subunit of the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier I(Kr), have been found to underlie the congenital Long-QT syndrome, LQT2. LQT2 may give rise to severe arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death.We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2 genotypes can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and consequently the QT interval on the ECG.We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr) channels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the cardiac ventricular cell.Using this virtual transgenic cell model, we describe the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action potential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect results in a net loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD.This study demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD sufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype is shown to depend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect I(Kr) during the time course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects in HERG can lead to impaired cellular electrophysiology can improve our understanding of the link between channel structure and cellular function.",

    "synopsis": "The ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels are composed of sulfonylurea receptor and inwardly rectifying K(+) channel (Kir6.2) subunit. These channels are regulated by intracellular ADP/ATP ratio and play a role in cellular metabolism. Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine-specific alkylating reagent, is known to modify the histidine residues of the structure of proteins. The objective of this study was to determine whether DEPC modifies K(ATP)-channel activity in pituitary GH(3) cells. Steady-state fluctuation analyses of macroscopic K(+) current at -120 mV produced power spectra that could be fitted with a single Lorentzian curve in these cells. The time constants in the presence of DEPC were increased. Consistent with fluctuation analyses, the mean open time of K(ATP)-channels was significantly increased during exposure to DEPC. However, DEPC produced no change in single-channel conductance, despite the ability of this compound to enhance K(ATP)-channel activity in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 16 microM. DEPC-stimulated K(ATP)-channel activity was attenuated by pretreatment with glibenclamide. In current-clamp configuration, DEPC decreased the firing of action potentials in GH(3) cells. A further application of glibenclamide reversed DEPC-induced inhibition of spontaneous action potentials. Intracellullar Ca(2+) measurements revealed the ability of DEPC to decrease Ca(2+) oscillations in GH(3) cells. Simulation studies also demonstrated that the increased conductance of K(ATP)-channels used to mimic DEPC actions reduced the frequency of spontaneous action potentials and fluctuation of intracellular Ca(2+). The results indicate that chemical modification with DEPC enhances K(ATP)-channel activity and influences functional activities of pituitary GH(3) cells.",

Nevertheless, signaling networks have evolved that maintain specificity from signal to cellular response. Here, we develop a framework for the analysis of networks containing two or more interconnected signaling pathways. We define two properties, specificity and fidelity, that all pathways in a network must possess in order to avoid paradoxical situations where one pathway activates another pathway's output, or responds to another pathway's input, more than its own. In unembellished networks that share components, it is impossible for all pathways to have both mutual specificity and mutual fidelity. However, inclusion of either of two related insulating mechanisms--compartmentalization or the action of a scaffold protein--allows both properties to be achieved, provided deactivation rates are fast compared to exchange rates.",

    "synopsis": "Complex physiological interactions determine the functional consequences of gene abnormalities and make mechanistic interpretation of phenotypes extremely difficult. A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function.Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation.We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities.",

    "synopsis": "We develop a mathematical model that explicitly represents many of the known signaling components mediating translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 to gain insight into the complexities of metabolic insulin signaling pathways. A novel mechanistic model of postreceptor events including phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequent activation of downstream kinases Akt and protein kinase C-zeta is coupled with previously validated subsystem models of insulin receptor binding, receptor recycling, and GLUT4 translocation. A system of differential equations is defined by the structure of the model. Rate constants and model parameters are constrained by published experimental data. Model simulations of insulin dose-response experiments agree with published experimental data and also generate expected qualitative behaviors such as sequential signal amplification and increased sensitivity of downstream components. We examined the consequences of incorporating feedback pathways as well as representing pathological conditions, such as increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphatases, to illustrate the utility of our model for exploring molecular mechanisms. We conclude that mathematical modeling of signal transduction pathways is a useful approach for gaining insight into the complexities of metabolic insulin signaling.",

    "synopsis": "Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations approximately 1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K+ current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both IBK and IA could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. IBK always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while IA could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that",

    "synopsis": "We present a two-compartment model to explain the oscillatory behavior observed experimentally in activated neutrophils. Our model is based mainly on the peroxidase-oxidase reaction catalyzed by myeloperoxidase with melatonin as a cofactor and NADPH oxidase, a major protein in the phagosome membrane of the leukocyte. The model predicts that after activation of a neutrophil, an increase in the activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt and the delivery of myeloperoxidase into the phagosome results in oscillations in oxygen and NAD(P)H concentration. The period of oscillation changes from >200 s to 10-30 s. The model is consistent with previously reported oscillations in cell metabolism and oxidant production. Key features and predictions of the model were confirmed experimentally. The requirement of the hexose monophosphate pathway for 10 s oscillations was verified using 6-aminonicotinamide and dexamethasone, which are inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The role of the NADPH oxidase in promoting oscillations was confirmed by dose-response studies of the effect of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the model predicted an increase in the amplitude of NADPH oscillations in the presence of melatonin, which was confirmed experimentally. Successful computer modeling of complex chemical dynamics within cells and their chemical perturbation will enhance our ability to identify new antiinflammatory compounds.",

    "synopsis": "Immediately following fertilization, the fruit fly embryo undergoes 13 rapid, synchronous, syncytial nuclear division cycles driven by maternal genes and proteins. During these mitotic cycles, there are barely detectable oscillations in the total level of B-type cyclins. In this paper, we propose a dynamical model for the molecular events underlying these early nuclear division cycles in Drosophila. The model distinguishes nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the embryo and permits exploration of a variety of rules for protein transport between the compartments. Numerical simulations reproduce the main features of wild-type mitotic cycles: patterns of protein accumulation and degradation, lengthening of later cycles, and arrest in interphase 14. The model is consistent with mutations that introduce subtle changes in the number of mitotic cycles before interphase arrest. Bifurcation analysis of the differential equations reveals the dependence of mitotic oscillations on cycle number, and how this dependence is altered by mutations. The model can be used to predict the phenotypes of novel mutations and effective ranges of the unmeasured rate constants and transport coefficients in the proposed mechanism.",

The quantitative effect of ATP concentration upon the oscillations was successfully simulated. Our simulation results support previous experimental explanations that the Ca(2+) oscillations are mainly due to interaction of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump back into the ER, and the oscillations are prolonged by extracellular Ca(2+) entry that maintains the constant Ca(2+) supplies to its intracellular stores. The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the Ca(2+) oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, the model simulation results for the Ca(2+) oscillations characteristics such as duration, peak [Ca(2+)](cyt), and average interval, etc., lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of Ca(2+) oscillations in different types of cells.",

In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.",

However, disease-associated aberrant activity of the pathway is often due to misregulation of the equilibrium state. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is typically described as being held inactive in the cytoplasm by binding its inhibitor, IkappaB, until an external stimulus triggers IkappaB degradation through an IkappaB kinase-dependent degradation pathway. Combining genetic, biochemical, and computational tools, we investigate steady-state regulation of the NF-kappaB signaling module and its impact on stimulus responsiveness. We present newly measured in vivo degradation rate constants for NF-kappaB-bound and -unbound IkappaB proteins that are critical for accurate computational predictions of steady-state IkappaB protein levels and basal NF-kappaB activity. Simulations reveal a homeostatic NF-kappaB signaling module in which differential degradation rates of free and bound pools of IkappaB represent a novel cross-regulation mechanism that imparts functional robustness to the signaling module.",

    "synopsis": "Bone remodeling occurs asynchronously at multiple sites in the adult skeleton and involves resorption by osteoclasts, followed by formation of new bone by osteoblasts. Disruptions in bone remodeling contribute to the pathogenesis of disorders such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and Paget's disease. Interactions among cells of osteoblast and osteoclast lineages are critical in the regulation of bone remodeling. We constructed a mathematical model of autocrine and paracrine interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts that allowed us to calculate cell population dynamics and changes in bone mass at a discrete site of bone remodeling. The model predicted different modes of dynamic behavior: a single remodeling cycle in response to an external stimulus, a series of internally regulated cycles of bone remodeling, or unstable behavior similar to pathological bone remodeling in Paget's disease. Parametric analysis demonstrated that the mode of dynamic behavior in the system depends strongly on the regulation of osteoclasts by autocrine factors, such as transforming growth factor beta. Moreover, simulations demonstrated that nonlinear dynamics of the system may explain the differing effects of immunosuppressants on bone remodeling in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the mathematical model revealed that interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts result in complex, nonlinear system behavior, which cannot be deduced from studies of each cell type alone. The model will be useful in future studies assessing the impact of cytokines, growth factors, and potential therapies on the overall process of remodeling in normal bone and in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease.",

    "synopsis": "The Wnt and the extracellular signal regulated-kinase (ERK) pathways are both involved in the pathogenesis of various kinds of cancers. Recently, the existence of crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways was reported. Gathering all reported results, we have discovered a positive feedback loop embedded in the crosstalk between the Wnt and ERK pathways. We have developed a plausible model that represents the role of this hidden positive feedback loop in the Wnt/ERK pathway crosstalk based on the integration of experimental reports and employing established basic mathematical models of each pathway. Our analysis shows that the positive feedback loop can generate bistability in both the Wnt and ERK signaling pathways, and this prediction was further validated by experiments. In particular, using the commonly accepted assumption that mutations in signaling proteins contribute to cancerogenesis, we have found two conditions through which mutations could evoke an irreversible response leading to a sustained activation of both pathways. One condition is enhanced production of beta-catenin, the other is a reduction of the velocity of MAP kinase phosphatase(s). This enables that high activities of Wnt and ERK pathways are maintained even without a persistent extracellular signal. Thus, our study adds a novel aspect to the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis by showing that mutational changes in individual proteins can cause fundamental functional changes well beyond the pathway they function in by a positive feedback loop embedded in crosstalk. Thus, crosstalk between signaling pathways provides a vehicle through which mutations of individual components can affect properties of the system at a larger scale.",

Despite our understanding of the structural changes, which occur upon Cdk/cyclin formation and activation, little is known about the dynamics of the molecular events involved. We have characterized the mechanism of Cdk2/cyclin A complex formation and activation at the molecular and dynamic level by rapid kinetics and demonstrate here that it is a two-step process. The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of Cdk2 and helices 3 and 5 of the cyclin to yield an intermediate complex in which the threonine in the T-loop is not accessible for phosphorylation. Additional contacts between the C-lobe of the Cdk and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin then induce the isomerization of the Cdk into a fully mature form by promoting the exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation by CAK and the formation of the substrate binding site. This conformational change is selective for the cyclin partner.",

    "synopsis": "Cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) play an important role in triggering the acute phase response of the body to injury or inflammation. Signaling by IL-6 involves two pathways: Janus-associated kinases (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT 3) are activated in the first pathway while the second pathway involves the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). While it is recognized that both pathways play a major role in IL-6 signal transduction, a majority of studies have focused on signaling through either one of the pathways. However, simultaneous signaling through both JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways is still poorly understood. In this work, a mathematical model has been developed that integrates signaling through both the JAK/STAT and the MAPK pathway. The presented model is used to analyze the effect of three molecules that are involved in the regulation of IL-6 signaling-SHP-2 (domain containing tyrosine phosphatase 2), SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), and a STAT3 nuclear phosphatase (PP2)-on the dynamics of IL-6 signal transduction in hepatocytes. The obtained results suggest that interactions between SHP-2 and SOCS3 influence signaling through the JAK/STAT and the MAPK pathways. It is shown that SHP-2 and SOCS3 do not just regulate the pathway that they are known to be associated with, (SHP-2 with MAPK and SOCS3 with JAK/STAT), but also have a strong effect on the other pathway. Several simulations with SOCS3, SHP-2, and PP2 knockout cells, that is, where the signaling pathway is unable to produce these proteins, have been performed to characterize the effect of these regulatory proteins on IL-6 signal transduction in hepatocytes.",

    "synopsis": "Integration of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator signals in the striatum plays a central role in the functions and dysfunctions of the basal ganglia. DARPP-32 is a key actor of this integration in the GABAergic medium-size spiny neurons, in particular in response to dopamine and glutamate. When phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), DARPP-32 inhibits protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), whereas when phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) it inhibits PKA. DARPP-32 is also regulated by casein kinases and by several protein phosphatases. These complex and intricate regulations make simple predictions of DARPP-32 dynamic behaviour virtually impossible. We used detailed quantitative modelling of the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation to improve our understanding of its function. The models included all the combinations of the three best-characterized phosphorylation sites of DARPP-32, their regulation by kinases and phosphatases, and the regulation of those enzymes by cAMP and Ca(2+) signals. Dynamic simulations allowed us to observe the temporal relationships between cAMP and Ca(2+) signals. We confirmed that the proposed regulation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) by calcium can account for the observed decrease of Threonine 75 phosphorylation upon glutamate receptor activation. DARPP-32 is not simply a switch between PP1-inhibiting and PKA-inhibiting states. Sensitivity analysis showed that CDK5 activity is a major regulator of the response, as previously suggested. Conversely, the strength of the regulation of PP2A by PKA or by calcium had little effect on the PP1-inhibiting function of DARPP-32 in these conditions. The simulations showed that DARPP-32 is not only a robust signal integrator, but that its response also depends on the delay between cAMP and calcium signals affecting the response to the latter. This integration did not depend on the concentration of DARPP-32, while the absolute effect on PP1 varied linearly. In silico mutants showed that Ser137 phosphorylation affects the influence of the delay between dopamine and glutamate, and that constitutive phosphorylation in Ser137 transforms DARPP-32 in a quasi-irreversible switch. This work is a first attempt to better understand the complex interactions between cAMP and Ca(2+) regulation of DARPP-32. Progressive inclusion of additional components should lead to a realistic model of signalling networks underlying the function of striatal neurons.",

When phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), DARPP-32 inhibits protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), whereas when phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) it inhibits PKA. DARPP-32 is also regulated by casein kinases and by several protein phosphatases. These complex and intricate regulations make simple predictions of DARPP-32 dynamic behaviour virtually impossible. We used detailed quantitative modelling of the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation to improve our understanding of its function. The models included all the combinations of the three best-characterized phosphorylation sites of DARPP-32, their regulation by kinases and phosphatases, and the regulation of those enzymes by cAMP and Ca(2+) signals. Dynamic simulations allowed us to observe the temporal relationships between cAMP and Ca(2+) signals. We confirmed that the proposed regulation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) by calcium can account for the observed decrease of Threonine 75 phosphorylation upon glutamate receptor activation. DARPP-32 is not simply a switch between PP1-inhibiting and PKA-inhibiting states. Sensitivity analysis showed that CDK5 activity is a major regulator of the response, as previously suggested. Conversely, the strength of the regulation of PP2A by PKA or by calcium had little effect on the PP1-inhibiting function of DARPP-32 in these conditions. The simulations showed that DARPP-32 is not only a robust signal integrator, but that its response also depends on the delay between cAMP and calcium signals affecting the response to the latter. This integration did not depend on the concentration of DARPP-32, while the absolute effect on PP1 varied linearly. In silico mutants showed that Ser137 phosphorylation affects the influence of the delay between dopamine and glutamate, and that constitutive phosphorylation in Ser137 transforms DARPP-32 in a quasi-irreversible switch. This work is a first attempt to better understand the complex interactions between cAMP and Ca(2+) regulation of DARPP-32. Progressive inclusion of additional components should lead to a realistic model of signalling networks underlying the function of striatal neurons.",

In this study, we present a model to represent the transcriptional regulatory network essential for the circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila. The model incorporates the transcriptional feedback loops revealed so far in the network of the circadian clock (PER/TIM and VRI/PDP1 loops). Conventional Hill functions are not assumed to describe the regulation of genes, instead of the explicit reactions of binding and unbinding processes of transcription factors to promoters are modelled. The model simulates sustained circadian oscillations in mRNA and protein concentrations in constant darkness in agreement with experimental observations. It also simulates entrainment by light-dark cycles, disappearance of the rhythmicity in constant light and the shape of phase response curves resembling that of the experimental results. The model is robust over a wide range of parameter variations. In addition, the simulated E-box mutation, per(S) and per(L) mutants are similar to that observed in the experiments. The deficiency between the simulated mRNA levels and experimental observations in per(01), tim(01) and clk(Jrk) mutants suggests some difference on the part of the model from reality.",

    "synopsis": "Imaging experiments have shown that cell signaling components such as Ras can be activated by growth factors at distinct subcellular locations. Trafficking between these subcellular locations is a regulated dynamic process. The effects of trafficking and the molecular mechanisms underlying compartment-specific Ras activation were studied using numerical simulations of an ordinary differential equation-based multi-compartment model. The simulations show that interplay between two distinct mechanisms, a palmitoylation cycle that controls Ras trafficking and a phospholipase C-epsilon (PLC-epsilon) driven feedback loop, can convert a transient calcium signal into prolonged Ras activation at the Golgi. Detailed analysis of the network identified PLC-epsilon as a key determinant of \"compartment switching\". Modulation of PLC-epsilon activity switches the location of activated Ras between the plasma membrane and Golgi through a new mechanism termed \"kinetic scaffolding\". These simulations indicate that multiple biochemical mechanisms, when appropriately coupled, can give rise to an intracellular compartment-specific sustained Ras activation in response to stimulation of growth factor receptors at the plasma membrane.",

It is found that the unusually high density and low sensitivity of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) are critical to the ability of the cell to generate and localize a calcium spike in a single dendritic spine. The results also demonstrate the model's capability to simulate the supralinear calcium spike observed experimentally during coincident activation of the parallel and climbing fibers. The sensitivity of the calcium spikes to certain biological and geometrical effects is investigated as well as the mechanisms that underlie the cell's ability to generate the supralinear spike. The sensitivity of calcium release rates from the IP3R to calcium concentrations, as well as IP3 concentrations, allows the calcium spike to form. The diffusion barrier caused by the small radius of the spine neck is shown to be important, as a threshold radius is observed above which a spike cannot be formed. Additionally, the calcium buffer capacity and diffusion rates from the spine are found to be important parameters in shaping the calcium spike.",

In this study, we aim at using systems biology approach to provide dynamic analysis on this pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We proposed a constraint-based modeling method to build a comprehensive mathematical model for the Smad dependent TGF-beta signaling pathway by fitting the experimental data and incorporating the qualitative constraints from the experimental analysis. The performance of the model generated by constraint-based modeling method is significantly improved compared to the model obtained by only fitting the quantitative data. The model agrees well with the experimental analysis of TGF-beta pathway, such as the time course of nuclear phosphorylated Smad, the subcellular location of Smad and signal response of Smad phosphorylation to different doses of TGF-beta. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The simulation results indicate that the signal response to TGF-beta is regulated by the balance between clathrin dependent endocytosis and non-clathrin mediated endocytosis. This model is useful to be built upon as new precise experimental data are emerging. The constraint-based modeling method can also be applied to quantitative modeling of other signaling pathways.",

Both cardiac inotropy and the progression of heart disease are affected by spatiotemporal variations in cAMP/PKA signaling, yet the dynamic patterns of PKA-mediated phosphorylation that influence differential responses to agonists have not been characterized. We performed live-cell imaging and systems modeling of PKA-mediated phosphorylation in neonatal cardiac myocytes in response to G-protein coupled receptor stimuli and UV photolysis of \"caged\" cAMP. cAMP accumulation was rate-limiting in PKA-mediated phosphorylation downstream of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Prostaglandin E1 stimulated higher PKA activity in the cytosol than at the sarcolemma, whereas isoproterenol triggered faster sarcolemmal responses than cytosolic, likely due to restricted cAMP diffusion from submembrane compartments. Localized UV photolysis of caged cAMP triggered gradients of PKA-mediated phosphorylation, enhanced by phosphodiesterase activity and PKA-mediated buffering of cAMP. These findings indicate that combining live-cell FRET imaging and mechanistic computational models can provide quantitative understanding of spatiotemporal signaling.",

In deterministic case, the oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ decrease the effective Ca2+ threshold for the activation of transcriptional activator (TF-A). The average activation of TF-A increases with the increase of the average amplitude of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, but decreases with the increase of the period of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, which are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results on the gene expression in lymphocytes. In stochastic case, it is found that a large internal fluctuation of the biochemical reaction can enhance gene expression efficiency specifically at a low level of external stimulations or at a small rate of TF-A dimer phosphorylation activated by Ca2+, which reduces the threshold of the average intracellular Ca2+ concentration for gene expression.",

They are important mediators of immune responses and growth and differentiation of various cell types. The STAT signalling system represents a defined functional module with a pattern of signalling that is conserved from flies to mammals. In order to probe and gain insights into the signalling properties of the STAT module by computational means, we developed a simple non-linear ordinary differential equations model within the 'Virtual Cell' framework. Our results demonstrate that the STAT module can operate as a 'biphasic amplitude filter' with an ability to amplify input signals within a specific intermediate range. We show that dimerisation of phosphorylated STAT is crucial for signal amplification and the amplitude filtering function. We also demonstrate that maximal amplification at intermediate levels of STAT activation is a moderately robust property of STAT module. We propose that these observations can be extrapolated to the analogous SMAD signalling module.",

    "synopsis": "A modified version of a previously developed mathematical model [Obeyesekere et al., Cell Prolif. (1997)] of the G1-phase of the cell cycle is presented. This model describes the regulation of the G1-phase that includes the interactions of the nuclear proteins, RB, cyclin E, cyclin D, cdk2, cdk4 and E2F. The effects of the growth factors on cyclin D synthesis under saturated or unsaturated growth factor conditions are investigated based on this model. The solutions to this model (a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations) are discussed with respect to existing experiments. Predictions based on mathematical analysis of this model are presented. In particular, results are presented on the existence of two stable solutions, i.e., bistability within the G1-phase. It is shown that this bistability exists under unsaturated growth factor concentration levels. This phenomenon is very noticeable if the efficiency of the signal transduction, initiated by the growth factors leading to cyclin D synthesis, is low. The biological significance of this result as well as possible experimental designs to test these predictions are presented.",

    "synopsis": "A detailed model mechanism for the G1/S transition in the mammalian cell cycle is presented and analysed by computer simulation to investigate whether the kinetic origins of the restriction point (R-point) can be identified. The R-point occurs in mid-to-late G1 phase and marks the transition between mitogen-dependent to mitogen-independent progression of the cell cycle. For purposes of computer simulations, the R-point is defined as the first point in time after mitosis where cutting off mitogen stimulation does not prevent the cell reaching the threshold activity of cyclin-E/cdk2 required for entry into S phase. The key components of the network that generate a dynamic switching behaviour associated with the R-point include a positive feedback loop between cyclin-E/cdk2 and Cdc25A, along with the mutually negative interaction between the cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and cyclin-E/cdk2. Simulations of the passage through the R-point were carried out and the factors affecting the position of the R-point in G1 are determined. The detailed model also shows various points in the network where the activation of cyclin-E/cdk2 can be initiated with or without the involvement of the retinoblastoma protein.",

    "synopsis": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus governs daily variations of physiology and behavior in mammals. Within single neurons, interlocked transcriptional/translational feedback loops generate circadian rhythms on the molecular level. We present a mathematical model that reflects the essential features of the mammalian circadian oscillator to characterize the differential roles of negative and positive feedback loops. The oscillations that are obtained have a 24-h period and are robust toward parameter variations even when the positive feedback is replaced by a constantly expressed activator. This demonstrates the crucial role of the negative feedback for rhythm generation. Moreover, it explains the rhythmic phenotype of Rev-erbalpha-/- mutant mice, where a positive feedback is missing. The interplay of negative and positive feedback reveals a complex dynamics. In particular, the model explains the unexpected rescue of circadian oscillations in Per2Brdm1/Cry2-/- double-mutant mice (Per2Brdm1 single-mutant mice are arrhythmic). Here, a decrease of positive feedback strength associated with mutating the Per2 gene is compensated by the Cry2-/- mutation that simultaneously decreases the negative feedback strength. Finally, this model leads us to a testable prediction of a molecular and behavioral phenotype: circadian oscillations should be rescued when arrhythmic Per2Brdm1 mutant mice are crossed with Rev- erbalpha -/- mutant mice.",

    "title": "A model for circadian rhythms in Drosophila incorporating the formation of a complex between the PER and TIM proteins.",
    "synopsis": "The authors present a model for circadian oscillations of the Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) proteins in Drosophila. The model for the circadian clock is based on multiple phosphorylation of PER and TIM and on the negative feedback exerted by a nuclear PER-TIM complex on the transcription of the per and tim genes. Periodic behavior occurs in a large domain of parameter space in the form of limit cycle oscillations. These sustained oscillations occur in conditions corresponding to continuous darkness or to entrainment by light-dark cycles and are in good agreement with experimental observations on the temporal variations of PER and TIM and of per and tim mRNAs. Birhythmicity (coexistence of two periodic regimes) and aperiodic oscillations (chaos) occur in a restricted range of parameter values. The results are compared to the predictions of a model based on the sole regulation by PER. Both the formation of a complex between PER and TIM and protein phosphorylation are found to favor oscillatory behavior. Determining how the period depends on several key parameters allows us to test possible molecular explanations proposed for the altered period in the per(l) and per(s) mutants. The extended model further allows the construction of phase-response curves based on the light-induced triggering of TIM degradation. These curves, established as a function of both the duration and magnitude of the effect of a light pulse, match the phase-response curves obtained experimentally in the wild type and per(s) mutant of Drosophila.",

To understand the quantitative behavior of this network, we have developed a tightly constrained computational model, exploiting the interplay between mathematical modeling and experimental strategies. The model simultaneously reproduces four distinct datasets with excellent accuracy and provides mechanistic insights into how the network operates. We use the model to make predictions about the outcome of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments and the behavior of a functionally impaired Smad2 mutant, which we then verify experimentally. Successful model performance strongly supports the hypothesis of a dynamic maintenance of Smad nuclear accumulation during active signaling. The presented work establishes Smad nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as a dynamic network that flexibly transmits quantitative features of the extracellular TGF-beta signal, such as its duration and intensity, into the nucleus.",

    "synopsis": "Key cellular functions and developmental processes rely on cascades of GTPases. GTPases of the Rab family provide a molecular ID code to the generation, maintenance and transport of intracellular compartments. Here, we addressed the molecular design principles of endocytosis by focusing on the conversion of early endosomes into late endosomes, which entails replacement of Rab5 by Rab7. We modelled this process as a cascade of functional modules of interacting Rab GTPases. We demonstrate that intermodule interactions share similarities with the toggle switch described for the cell cycle. However, Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion is rather based on a newly characterized 'cut-out switch' analogous to an electrical safety-breaker. Both designs require cooperativity of auto-activation loops when coupled to a large pool of cytoplasmic proteins. Live cell imaging and endosome tracking provide experimental support to the cut-out switch in cargo progression and conversion of endosome identity along the degradative pathway. We propose that, by reconciling module performance with progression of activity, the cut-out switch design could underlie the integration of modules in regulatory cascades from a broad range of biological processes.",

Model analysis and experimental validation show that (i) ErbB2 overexpression, which occurs in approximately 25% of all breast cancers, transforms transient EGF-induced signaling into sustained signaling, (ii) HRG-induced ERK activity is much more robust to the ERK cascade inhibitor U0126 than EGF-induced ERK activity, and (iii) phosphoinositol-3 kinase is a major regulator of post-peak but not pre-peak EGF-induced ERK activity. Sensitivity analysis leads to the hypothesis that ERK activation is robust to parameter perturbation at high ligand doses, while Akt activation is not.",

    "synopsis": "Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, BoNT/A is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking protein, SNAP-25, to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis of skeletal muscles induced by BoNT/A at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of coupled, first-order differential equations. In this study, the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 212:16-21,1980) was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other impermeable inhibitors of BoNT/A can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for BoNT/A binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin concentrations, a new BoNT/A species and rate (k(S)) were added at the beginning of the reaction sequence to create a 4-step scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate determined by k(S) to a free species that is capable of binding. By systematically adjusting the values of k(S), the 4-step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function (k(S) >or= 0.01), the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice following i.m. injections (k (S) = 0.001), and the slow onset of the therapeutic effects of BoNT/A (k(S) < 0.001) in man. This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by simulating experimental results, it helped to quantitatively define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect (t(inhib)) and the relation between this time and the rate of paralysis onset. The 4-step model predicted that as the rate of paralysis becomes slower, the estimated upper limits of (t(inhib)) for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More generally, this modeling approach may be useful in studying the kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by similar mechanisms, e.g., receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

    "synopsis": "A novel topology of regulatory networks abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle is studied by constructing a simple nonlinear model. A ternary positive feedback loop with only positive regulations is constructed with elements that activates the subsequent element in a clockwise fashion. A ternary negative feedback loop with only negative regulations is constructed with the elements that inhibit the subsequent element in an anticlockwise fashion. Positive feedback loop exhibits bistability, whereas the negative feedback loop exhibits limit cycle oscillations. The novelty of the topology is that the corresponding elements in these two homogeneous feedback loops are linked by the binary positive feedback loops with only positive regulations. This results in the emergence of mixed feedback loops in the network that displays complex behaviour like the coexistence of multiple steady states, relaxation oscillations and chaos. Importantly, the arrangement of the feedback loops brings in the notion of checkpoint in the model. The model also exhibits domino-like behaviour, where the limit cycle oscillations take place in a stepwise fashion. As the aforementioned topology is abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle, the events that govern the cell cycle are considered for the present study. In budding yeast, the sequential activation of the transcription factors, cyclins and their inhibitors form mixed feedback loops. The transcription factors that involve in the positive regulation in a clockwise orientation generates ternary positive feedback loop, while the cyclins and their inhibitors that involve in the negative regulation in an anticlockwise orientation generates ternary negative feedback loop. The mutual regulation between the corresponding elements in the transcription factors and the cyclins and their inhibitors generates binary positive feedback loops. The bifurcation diagram constructed for the whole system can be related to the different events of the cell cycle in terms of dynamical system theory. The checkpoint mechanism that plays an important role in different phases of the cell cycle are accounted for by silencing appropriate feedback loops in the model.",

The numerical simulations indicated that cell shape controls the dynamics of local biochemical activity of signal-modulated negative regulators, such as phosphodiesterases and protein phosphatases within regulatory loops to determine the size of microdomains of activated signaling components. The model prediction that negative regulators control the flow of spatial information to downstream components was verified experimentally in rat hippocampal slices.

The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin. It also accounts for known properties of calmodulin that have been difficult to model so far, including the activity of nonsaturated forms of calmodulin (we predict the existence of open conformations in the absence of calcium), an increase in calcium affinity once calmodulin is bound to a target, and the differential activation of CaMKII and PP2B depending on calcium concentration.",

This model uses the calcium-induced calcium release and inositol cross-coupling mechanisms coupled with a receptor-independent method for producing inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate as the heart of the model. By computationally mimicking experimental constraints we have found that this model provides results that are qualitatively similar to experiment.",

    "title": "Global parameter search reveals design principles of the mammalian circadian clock.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Virtually all living organisms have evolved a circadian (~24 hour) clock that controls physiological and behavioural processes with exquisite precision throughout the day/night cycle. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which generates these ~24 h rhythms in mammals, consists of several thousand neurons. Each neuron contains a gene-regulatory network generating molecular oscillations, and the individual neuron oscillations are synchronised by intercellular coupling, presumably via neurotransmitters. Although this basic mechanism is currently accepted and has been recapitulated in mathematical models, several fundamental questions about the design principles of the SCN remain little understood. For example, a remarkable property of the SCN is that the phase of the SCN rhythm resets rapidly after a 'jet lag' type experiment, i.e. when the light/dark (LD) cycle is abruptly advanced or delayed by several hours. RESULTS: Here, we describe an extensive parameter optimization of a previously constructed simplified model of the SCN in order to further understand its design principles. By examining the top 50 solutions from the parameter optimization, we show that the neurotransmitters' role in generating the molecular circadian rhythms is extremely important. In addition, we show that when a neurotransmitter drives the rhythm of a system of coupled damped oscillators, it exhibits very robust synchronization and is much more easily entrained to light/dark cycles. We were also able to recreate in our simulations the fast rhythm resetting seen after a 'jet lag' type experiment. CONCLUSION: Our work shows that a careful exploration of parameter space for even an extremely simplified model of the mammalian clock can reveal unexpected behaviours and non-trivial predictions. Our results suggest that the neurotransmitter feedback loop plays a crucial role in the robustness and phase resetting properties of the mammalian clock, even at the single neuron level.",

    "synopsis": "Polyamines are considered as essential compounds in living cells, since they are involved in cell proliferation, transcription, and translation processes. Furthermore, polyamine homeostasis is necessary to cell survival, and its deregulation is involved in relevant processes, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Great efforts have been made to elucidate the nature of polyamine homeostasis, giving rise to relevant information concerning the behavior of the different components of polyamine metabolism, and a great amount of information has been generated. However, a complex regulation at transcriptional, translational, and metabolic levels as well as the strong relationship between polyamines and essential cell processes make it difficult to discriminate the role of polyamine regulation itself from the whole cell response when an experimental approach is given in vivo. To overcome this limitation, a bottom-up approach to model mathematically metabolic pathways could allow us to elucidate the systemic behavior from individual kinetic and molecular properties. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of polyamine metabolism from kinetic constants and both metabolite and enzyme levels extracted from bibliographic sources. This model captures the tendencies observed in transgenic mice for the so-called key enzymes of polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermine spermidine N-acetyl transferase. Furthermore, the model shows a relevant role of S-adenosylmethionine and acetyl-CoA availability in polyamine homeostasis, which are not usually considered in systemic experimental studies.",

    "synopsis": "Here, we analyse the RanGTPase system and its coupling to receptor-mediated nuclear transport. Our simulations predict nuclear RanGTP levels in HeLa cells to be very sensitive towards the cellular energy charge and to exceed the cytoplasmic concentration approximately 1000-fold. The steepness of the RanGTP gradient appears limited by both the cytoplasmic RanGAP concentration and the imperfect retention of nuclear RanGTP by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), but not by the nucleotide exchange activity of RCC1. Neither RanBP1 nor the NPC localization of RanGAP has a significant direct impact on the RanGTP gradient. NTF2-mediated import of Ran appears to be the bottleneck for maximal capacity of Ran-driven nuclear transport. We show that unidirectional nuclear transport can be faithfully simulated without the assumption of a vectorial NPC passage; transport receptors only need to reversibly cross NPCs and switch their affinity for cargo in response to the RanGTP gradient. A significant RanGTP gradient after nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown can apparently exist only in large cytoplasm. This indicates that RanGTP gradients can provide positional information for mitotic spindle and NE assembly in early embryonic cells, but hardly any in small somatic cells.",

In different organisms, a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) composed of Mad2, Bub3, BubR1/Mad3, and Cdc20 inhibits the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) to initiate promotion into anaphase. The mechanism of MCC formation and its regulation by the kinetochore are unclear. Here, we constructed dynamical models of MCC formation involving different kinetochore control mechanisms including amplification as well as inhibition effects, and analysed their quantitative properties. In particular, in this system, fast and stable metaphase to anaphase transition can only be triggered when the kinetochore controls the Bub3:BubR1-related reactions; signal amplification and inhibition play a subordinate role. Furthermore, when introducing experimentally determined parameter values into the models analysed here, we found that effective MCC formation is not combined with complete Cdc20 sequestering. Instead, the MCC might bind and completely block the APC/C. The SACM might function by an MCC:APC/C complex rearrangement.",

    "synopsis": "For successful mitosis, metaphase has to be arrested until all centromeres are properly attached. The onset of anaphase, which is initiated by activating the APC, is controlled by the spindle assembly checkpoint (M)SAC. Mad2, which is a constitutive member of the (M)SAC, is supposed to inhibit the activity of the APC by sequestering away its co-activator Cdc20. Mad1 recruits Mad2 to unattached kinetochores and is compulsory for the establishment of the Mad2 and Cdc20 complexes. Recently, based on results from in vivo and in vitro studies, two biochemical models were proposed: the Template and the Exchange model. Here, we derive a mathematical description to compare the dynamical behaviour of the two models. Our simulation analysis supports the Template model. Using experimentally determined values for the model parameters, the Cdc20 concentration is reduced down to only about half. Thus, although the Template model displays good metaphase-to-anaphase switching behaviour, it is not able to completely describe (M)SAC regulation. This situation is neither improved by amplification nor by p31(comet) inhibition. We speculate that either additional reaction partners are required for total inhibition of Cdc20 or an extended mechanism has to be introduced for (M)SAC regulation.",

First, we present a simple model of the antagonistic interactions between cyclin-dependent kinases and the anaphase promoting complex, which shows how progress through the cell cycle can be thought of as irreversible transitions (Start and Finish) between two stable states (G1 and S-G2-M) of the regulatory system.

    "synopsis": "We propose a seven variable model with time delay in one of the variables for the cell cycle in higher eukaryotes. The model consists of four important phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (P-D) cycles that govern the cell cycle, namely Pre-MPF-MPF, Cdc25P-Cdc25, Wee1P-Wee1 and APCP-APC. Other variables are cyclin, free cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) and mass. The mass acts as a G2/M checkpoint and the checkpoint is represented by a saddle node loop bifurcation. The key feature of the model is that a time lag has been introduced in the activation of anaphase promoting complex (APC) by maturation promoting factor (MPF). This is effected by treating MPF as a time-delayed variable in the activation step of APC. The time lag acts as a spindle checkpoint. Absence of time delay induces a bistability in our model. Time delay also brings about variability in G1 phase timings. The model also reproduces the mutant phenotype experiments on wee1 cells. Stochasticity has been introduced in the model to simulate the dependence of the cycle time on cell birth length. Mutant phenotypes in the stochastic model reproduce the experimental observations better than the deterministic model.",

To study vectorial transport in a quantitative manner, an in vitro model was used that includes polarized MDCKII cells stably expressing the recombinant human uptake transporter OATP1B3 in their basolateral membrane and the recombinant ATP-driven efflux pump ABCC2 in their apical membrane. These double-transfected cells enabled mathematical modeling of the vectorial transport of the anionic prototype substance bromosulfophthalein (BSP) that has frequently been used to examine hepatobiliary transport. Time-dependent analyses of (3)H-labeled BSP in the basolateral, intracellular, and apical compartments of cells cultured on filter membranes and efflux experiments in cells preloaded with BSP were performed. A mathematical model was fitted to the experimental data. Data-based modeling was optimized by including endogenous transport processes in addition to the recombinant transport proteins. The predominant contributions to the overall vectorial transport of BSP were mediated by OATP1B3 (44%) and ABCC2 (28%). Model comparison predicted a previously unrecognized endogenous basolateral efflux process as a negative contribution to total vectorial transport, amounting to 19%, which is in line with the detection of the basolateral efflux pump Abcc4 in MDCKII cells. Rate-determining steps in the vectorial transport were identified by calculating control coefficients. Data-based mathematical modeling of vectorial transport of BSP as a model substance resulted in a quantitative description of this process and its components. The same systems biology approach may be applied to other cellular systems and to different substances.",

The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous subunits in which each subunit binds 1 equiv of 5-coordinate high-spin heme. .NO increases the Vmax of sGC up to 400-fold and has previously been shown to bind to the heme to form a 5-coordinate complex. Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, it is demonstrated that the binding of .NO to the heme of sGC is a complex process. .NO first binds to the heme to form a 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex, which then converts to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex through one of two ways. For 28 +/- 4% of the heme, the 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex rapidly (approximately 20 s-1) converts to the 5-coordinate complex. For the remaining 72 +/- 4% of the heme, the conversion of the 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex is slow (0.1-1.0 s-1) and is dependent upon the interaction of .NO with an unidentified non-heme site on the protein. The heme (200 nM) was completely converted to the 5-coordinate state with as little as 500 nM .NO, and the equilibrium dissociation constant of .NO for activating the enzyme was determined to be < or = 250 nM. Gel-filtration analysis indicates that the binding of .NO to the heme has no effect on the native molecular mass of the protein. Correlation of electronic absorption spectra with activity measurements indicates that the 5-coordinate nitrosyl form of the enzyme is activated relative to the resting 5-coordinate ferrous form of the enzyme.",

To understand this process, we developed a 10-step kinetic model in which the ferric heme-NO enzyme forms as the immediate product of catalysis, and then partitions between NO dissociation versus reduction to a ferrous heme-NO complex. Rate constants used for the model were derived from recent literature or were determined here. Computer simulations of the model precisely described both pre-steady and steady-state features of nNOS catalysis, including NADPH consumption and NO production, buildup of a heme-NO complex, changes between pre-steady and steady-state rates, and the change in enzyme K(m,O(2)) in the presence or absence of NO synthesis. The model also correctly simulated the catalytic features of nNOS mutants W409F and W409Y, which are hyperactive and display less heme-NO complex formation in the steady state. Model simulations showed how the rate of heme reduction influences several features of nNOS catalysis, including populations of NO-bound versus NO-free enzyme in the steady state and the rate of NO synthesis. The simulation predicts that there is an optimum rate of heme reduction that is close to the measured rate in nNOS. Ratio between NADPH consumption and NO synthesis is also predicted to increase with faster heme reduction. Our kinetic model is an accurate and versatile tool for understanding catalytic behavior and will provide new perspectives on NOS regulation.",

    "synopsis": "The chemotactic response of bacteria is mediated by complexes containing two molecules each of a transmembrane receptor and the intracellular signaling proteins CheA and CheW. Mutants in which one or the other of the proteins of this complex are absent, inactive, or expressed at elevated amounts show altered chemotactic behavior and the phenotypes are difficult to interpret for some overexpression mutants. We have examined the possibility that these unexpected phenotypes might arise from the binding steps that lead to active complex formation. A limited genetic algorithm was used to search for sets of binding reactions and associated binding constants expected to give mutant phenotypes in accord with experimental data. Different sets of binding equilibria and different assumptions about the activity of particular receptor complexes were tried. Computer analysis demonstrated that it is possible to obtain sets of binding equilibria consistent with the observed phenotypes and provided a simple explanation for these phenotypes in terms of the distribution of active and inactive complexes formed under various conditions. Optimization methods of this kind offer a unique way to analyze reactions taking place inside living cells based on behavioral data.",

    "title": "Modeling the segmentation clock as a network of coupled oscillations in the Notch, Wnt and FGF signaling pathways.",
    "synopsis": "The formation of somites in the course of vertebrate segmentation is governed by an oscillator known as the segmentation clock, which is characterized by a period ranging from 30 min to a few hours depending on the organism. This oscillator permits the synchronized activation of segmentation genes in successive cohorts of cells in the presomitic mesoderm in response to a periodic signal emitted by the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Recent microarray experiments [Dequeant, M.L., Glynn, E., Gaudenz, K., Wahl, M., Chen, J., Mushegian, A., Pourquie, O., 2006. A complex oscillating network of signaling genes underlies the mouse segmentation clock. Science 314, 1595-1598] indicate that the Notch, Wnt and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways are involved in the mechanism of the segmentation clock. By means of computational modeling, we investigate the conditions in which sustained oscillations occur in these three signaling pathways. First we show that negative feedback mediated by the Lunatic Fringe protein on intracellular Notch activation can give rise to periodic behavior in the Notch pathway. We then show that negative feedback exerted by Axin2 on the degradation of beta-catenin through formation of the Axin2 destruction complex can produce oscillations in the Wnt pathway. Likewise, negative feedback on FGF signaling mediated by the phosphatase product of the gene MKP3/Dusp6 can produce oscillatory gene expression in the FGF pathway. Coupling the Wnt, Notch and FGF oscillators through common intermediates can lead to synchronized oscillations in the three signaling pathways or to complex periodic behavior, depending on the relative periods of oscillations in the three pathways. The phase relationships between cycling genes in the three pathways depend on the nature of the coupling between the pathways and on their relative autonomous periods. The model provides a framework for analyzing the dynamics of the segmentation clock in terms of a network of oscillating modules involving the Wnt, Notch and FGF signaling pathways.",

In combination with De Young-Keizer-Li-Rinzel model, we successfully reproduce a sustained Ca(2+) oscillation in cytoplasm. Our results reveal that Ca(2+) oscillation dynamics in cytoplasm can be significantly affected by the way how the Orai1 CRAC channel are assembled and activated. A low sustained Ca(2+) influx is observed through the CRAC channels across the plasma membrane. In particular, our model shows that a tetrameric channel complex can effectively regulate the total quantity of the channels and the ratio of the active channels to the total channels, and a period of Ca(2+) oscillation about 29 s is in agreement with published experimental data. The bifurcation analyses illustrate the different dynamic properties between our mixed Ca(2+) feedback model and the single positive or negative feedback models.",

    "synopsis": "The animal cell cycle is controlled by the periodic variation of two cyclin-dependent protein kinases, cdk1 and cdk2, which govern the entry into the M (mitosis) and S (DNA replication) phases, respectively. The ordered progression between these phases is achieved thanks to the existence of checkpoint mechanisms based on mutual inhibition of these processes. Here we study a simple theoretical model for oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2 activity, involving mutual inhibition of the two oscillators. Each minimal oscillator is described by a three-variable cascade involving a cdk, together with the associated cyclin and cyclin-degrading enzyme. The dynamics of this skeleton model of coupled oscillators is determined as a function of the strength of their mutual inhibition. The most common mode of dynamic behavior, obtained under conditions of strong mutual inhibition, is that of alternating oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2, which correspond to the physiological situation of the ordered recurrence of the M and S phases. In addition, for weaker inhibition we obtain evidence for a variety of dynamic phenomena such as complex periodic oscillations, chaos, and the coexistence between multiple periodic or chaotic attractors. We discuss the conditions of occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior, as well as their possible physiological significance.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that the system of cell-cycle control based on the transcriptional regulation of the expression of specific genes is responsible for the transition between programs. These groups of functionally connected genes from so-called gene networks characterized by numerous feedbacks and a complex behavioral dynamics. Computer simulation methods have been applied to studying the dynamics of gene networks regulating the cell cycle of vertebrates. The data on the regulation of the key genes obtained from the CYCLE-TRRD database have been used as a basis to construct gene networks of different degrees of complexity controlling the G1/S transition, one of the most important stages of the cell cycle. The behavior dynamics of the model constructed has been analyzed. Two qualitatively different functional modes of the system has been obtained. It has also been shown that the transition between these modes depends on the duration of the proliferation signal. It has also been demonstrated that the additional feedback from factor E2F to genes c-fos and c-jun, which was predicted earlier based on the computer analysis of promoters, plays an important role in the transition of the cell to the S phase.",

    "synopsis": "A mathematical model of glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei was developed previously on the basis of all available enzyme kinetic data (Bakker, B. M., Michels, P. A. M., Opperdoes, F. R., and Westerhoff, H. V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3207-3215). The model predicted correctly the fluxes and cellular metabolite concentrations as measured in non-growing trypanosomes and the major contribution to the flux control exerted by the plasma membrane glucose transporter. Surprisingly, a large overcapacity was predicted for hexokinase (HXK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PYK). Here, we present our further analysis of the control of glycolytic flux in bloodstream form T. brucei. First, the model was optimized and extended with recent information about the kinetics of enzymes and their activities as measured in lysates of in vitro cultured growing trypanosomes. Second, the concentrations of five glycolytic enzymes (HXK, PFK, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and PYK) in trypanosomes were changed by RNA interference. The effects of the knockdown of these enzymes on the growth, activities, and levels of various enzymes and glycolytic flux were studied and compared with model predictions. Data thus obtained support the conclusion from the in silico analysis that HXK, PFK, and PYK are in excess, albeit less than predicted. Interestingly, depletion of PFK and enolase had an effect on the activity (but not, or to a lesser extent, expression) of some other glycolytic enzymes. Enzymes located both in the glycosomes (the peroxisome-like organelles harboring the first seven enzymes of the glycolytic pathway of trypanosomes) and in the cytosol were affected. These data suggest the existence of novel regulatory mechanisms operating in trypanosome glycolysis.",

For this purpose, a detailed kinetic model of the system in the plant model Arabidopsis was constructed on the basis of in vitro kinetic measurements. The data, assembled into a mathematical model, reproduce in vivo measurements and also provide non-intuitive predictions. A crucial result is the identification of allosteric interactions whose function is not to couple demand and supply but to maintain a high independence between fluxes in competing pathways. In addition, the model shows that enzyme isoforms are not functionally redundant, because they contribute unequally to the flux and its regulation. Another result is the identification of the threonine concentration as the most sensitive variable in the system, suggesting a regulatory role for threonine at a higher level of integration.",

    "synopsis": "A mathematical model is developed for the folate cycle based on standard biochemical kinetics. We use the model to provide new insights into several different mechanisms of folate homeostasis. The model reproduces the known pool sizes of folate substrates and the fluxes through each of the loops of the folate cycle and has the qualitative behavior observed in a variety of experimental studies. Vitamin B(12) deficiency, modeled as a reduction in the V(max) of the methionine synthase reaction, results in a secondary folate deficiency via the accumulation of folate as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (the \"methyl trap\"). One form of homeostasis is revealed by the fact that a 100-fold up-regulation of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase (known to occur at the G(1)/S transition) dramatically increases pyrimidine production without affecting the other reactions of the folate cycle. The model also predicts that an almost total inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is required to significantly inhibit the thymidylate synthase reaction, consistent with experimental and clinical studies on the effects of methotrexate. Sensitivity to variation in enzymatic parameters tends to be local in the cycle and inversely proportional to the number of reactions that interconvert two folate substrates. Another form of homeostasis is a consequence of the nonenzymatic binding of folate substrates to folate enzymes. Without folate binding, the velocities of the reactions decrease approximately linearly as total folate is decreased. In the presence of folate binding and allosteric inhibition, the velocities show a remarkable constancy as total folate is decreased.",

    "title": "Isoform switching facilitates period control in the Neurospora crassa circadian clock.",
    "synopsis": "A striking and defining feature of circadian clocks is the small variation in period over a physiological range of temperatures. This is referred to as temperature compensation, although recent work has suggested that the variation observed is a specific, adaptive control of period. Moreover, given that many biological rate constants have a Q(10) of around 2, it is remarkable that such clocks remain rhythmic under significant temperature changes. We introduce a new mathematical model for the Neurospora crassa circadian network incorporating experimental work showing that temperature alters the balance of translation between a short and long form of the FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein. This is used to discuss period control and functionality for the Neurospora system. The model reproduces a broad range of key experimental data on temperature dependence and rhythmicity, both in wild-type and mutant strains. We present a simple mechanism utilising the presence of the FRQ isoforms (isoform switching) by which period control could have evolved, and argue that this regulatory structure may also increase the temperature range where the clock is robustly rhythmic.",

    "synopsis": "Differentiation of naive T lymphocytes into type I T helper (Th1) cells requires interferon-gamma and interleukin-12. It is puzzling that interferon-gamma induces the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, whereas interleukin-12 mediates Th1 cell lineage differentiation. We use mathematical modeling to analyze the expression kinetics of T-bet, interferon-gamma, and the IL-12 receptor beta2 chain (IL-12Rbeta2) during Th1 cell differentiation, in the presence or absence of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma signaling. We show that interferon-gamma induced initial T-bet expression, whereas IL-12Rbeta2 was repressed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The termination of TCR signaling permitted upregulation of IL-12Rbeta2 by T-bet and interleukin-12 signaling that maintained T-bet expression. This late expression of T-bet, accompanied by the upregulation of the transcription factors Runx3 and Hlx, was required to imprint the Th cell for interferon-gamma re-expression. Thus initial polarization and subsequent imprinting of Th1 cells are mediated by interlinked, sequentially acting positive feedback loops of TCR-interferon-gamma-Stat1-T-bet and interleukin-12-Stat4-T-bet signaling.",

    "title": "Minimum criteria for DNA damage-induced phase advances in circadian rhythms.",
    "synopsis": "Robust oscillatory behaviors are common features of circadian and cell cycle rhythms. These cyclic processes, however, behave distinctively in terms of their periods and phases in response to external influences such as light, temperature, nutrients, etc. Nevertheless, several links have been found between these two oscillators. Cell division cycles gated by the circadian clock have been observed since the late 1950s. On the other hand, ionizing radiation (IR) treatments cause cells to undergo a DNA damage response, which leads to phase shifts (mostly advances) in circadian rhythms. Circadian gating of the cell cycle can be attributed to the cell cycle inhibitor kinase Wee1 (which is regulated by the heterodimeric circadian clock transcription factor, BMAL1/CLK), and possibly in conjunction with other cell cycle components that are known to be regulated by the circadian clock (i.e., c-Myc and cyclin D1). It has also been shown that DNA damage-induced activation of the cell cycle regulator, Chk2, leads to phosphorylation and destruction of a circadian clock component (i.e., PER1 in Mus or FRQ in Neurospora crassa). However, the molecular mechanism underlying how DNA damage causes predominantly phase advances in the circadian clock remains unknown. In order to address this question, we employ mathematical modeling to simulate different phase response curves (PRCs) from either dexamethasone (Dex) or IR treatment experiments. Dex is known to synchronize circadian rhythms in cell culture and may generate both phase advances and delays. We observe unique phase responses with minimum delays of the circadian clock upon DNA damage when two criteria are met: (1) existence of an autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism in addition to the time-delayed negative feedback loop in the clock system and (2) Chk2-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of PERs that are not bound to BMAL1/CLK.",

    "title": "The multifarious short-term regulation of ammonium assimilation of Escherichia coli: dissection using an in silico replica.",
    "synopsis": "Ammonium assimilation in Escherichia coli is regulated through multiple mechanisms (metabolic, signal transduction leading to covalent modification, transcription, and translation), which (in-)directly affect the activities of its two ammonium-assimilating enzymes, i.e. glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Much is known about the kinetic properties of the components of the regulatory network that these enzymes are part of, but the ways in which, and the extents to which the network leads to subtle and quasi-intelligent regulation are unappreciated. To determine whether our present knowledge of the interactions between and the kinetic properties of the components of this network is complete - to the extent that when integrated in a kinetic model it suffices to calculate observed physiological behaviour - we now construct a kinetic model of this network, based on all of the kinetic data on the components that is available in the literature. We use this model to analyse regulation of ammonium assimilation at various carbon statuses for cells that have adapted to low and high ammonium concentrations. We show how a sudden increase in ammonium availability brings about a rapid redirection of the ammonium assimilation flux from GS/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) to GDH. The extent of redistribution depends on the nitrogen and carbon status of the cell. We develop a method to quantify the relative importance of the various regulators in the network. We find the importance is shared among regulators. We confirm that the adenylylation state of GS is the major regulator but that a total of 40% of the regulation is mediated by ADP (22%), glutamate (10%), glutamine (7%) and ATP (1%). The total steady-state ammonium assimilation flux is remarkably robust against changes in the ammonium concentration, but the fluxes through GS and GDH are completely nonrobust. Gene expression of GOGAT above a threshold value makes expression of GS under ammonium-limited conditions, and of GDH under glucose-limited conditions, sufficient for ammonium assimilation.",

As the glyoxylate bypass is essential for persistent bacilli, interference with it holds the potential for designing new antibacterial drugs. We have developed kinetic models of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate bypass in Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and studied the effects of inhibition of various enzymes in the M. tuberculosis model. RESULTS: We used E. coli to validate the pathway-modeling protocol and showed that changes in metabolic flux can be estimated from gene expression data. The M. tuberculosis model reproduced the observation that deletion of one of the two isocitrate lyase genes has little effect on bacterial growth in macrophages, but deletion of both genes leads to the elimination of the bacilli from the lungs. It also substantiated the inhibition of isocitrate lyases by 3-nitropropionate. On the basis of our simulation studies, we propose that: (i) fractional inactivation of both isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is required for a flux through the glyoxylate bypass in persistent mycobacteria; and (ii) increasing the amount of active isocitrate dehydrogenases can stop the flux through the glyoxylate bypass, so the kinase that inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and/or the proposed inactivator of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is a potential target for drugs against persistent mycobacteria. In addition, competitive inhibition of isocitrate lyases along with a reduction in the inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenases appears to be a feasible strategy for targeting persistent mycobacteria. CONCLUSION: We used kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways to assess various potential anti-tuberculous drug targets that interfere with the glyoxylate bypass flux, and indicated the type of inhibition needed to eliminate the pathogen.

However, little is known about the dynamics and regulatory logic linking initiators and effectors. Using a combination of live-cell reporters, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, we find that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical model of core apoptosis pathways, experimental perturbation of regulatory links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay. We identify conditions in which restraint is impaired, creating a physiologically indeterminate state of partial cell death with the potential to generate genomic instability. Together, these findings provide a quantitative picture of caspase regulatory networks and their failure modes.",

    "synopsis": "Crosstalk mechanisms have not been studied as thoroughly as individual signaling pathways. We exploit experimental and computational approaches to reveal how a concordant interplay between the insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling networks can potentiate mitogenic signaling. In HEK293 cells, insulin is a poor activator of the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade, yet it enhances ERK activation by low EGF doses. We find that major crosstalk mechanisms that amplify ERK signaling are localized upstream of Ras and at the Ras/Raf level. Computational modeling unveils how critical network nodes, the adaptor proteins GAB1 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Src kinase, and phosphatase SHP2, convert insulin-induced increase in the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) concentration into enhanced Ras/ERK activity. The model predicts and experiments confirm that insulin-induced amplification of mitogenic signaling is abolished by disrupting PIP(3)-mediated positive feedback via GAB1 and IRS. We demonstrate that GAB1 behaves as a non-linear amplifier of mitogenic responses and insulin endows EGF signaling with robustness to GAB1 suppression. Our results show the feasibility of using computational models to identify key target combinations and predict complex cellular responses to a mixture of external cues.",

    "synopsis": "We have constructed a model of the upper part of the glycolysis in the pancreatic beta-cell. The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and/or GAPD activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and/or GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible. The theoretical results presented in this study apply to the study of insulin secretion mechanisms, since glycolytic oscillations have been proposed as a cause of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio which is linked to insulin secretion.",

RESULTS: We propose a systematic treatment of model reduction of multiscale biochemical networks. First, we consider linear kinetic models, which appear as \"pseudo-monomolecular\" subsystems of multiscale nonlinear reaction networks.

This paper focuses on the role of small modules and feedbacks in the gene-protein network governing the G1/S transition in mammalian cells. Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. RESULTS: We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling the G1/S transition. It is shown that the positive feedback regulation of E2F1 and a double activator-inhibitor module can lead to bistability. Extensions of the core module preserve the essential features such as bistability. The complete model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in addition to bistability. We relate these bifurcations to the cell cycle checkpoint and the G1/S phase transition point. Thus, core modules can explain major features of the complex G1/S network and have a robust decision taking function.",

Tools for quantifying parametric robustness are needed. RESULTS: Two techniques for describing quantitatively the robustness of an oscillatory model were presented and contrasted. Single-parameter bifurcation analysis was used to evaluate the stability robustness of the limit cycle oscillation as well as the frequency and amplitude of oscillations. A tool from control engineering--the structural singular value (SSV)--was used to quantify robust stability of the limit cycle. Using SSV analysis, we find very poor robustness when the model's parameters are allowed to vary. CONCLUSION: The results show the usefulness of incorporating SSV analysis to single parameter sensitivity analysis to quantify robustness.",

    "synopsis": "Analysis of cellular signalling interactions is expected to create an enormous informatics challenge, perhaps even greater than that of analysing the genome. A key step in the evolution towards a more quantitative understanding of signalling is to specify explicitly the kinetics of all chemical reaction steps in a pathway. We have reconstructed a model of the nuclear factor, kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway, containing 64 parameters and 26 variables, including steps in which the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor is intimately associated with the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of its inhibitor kappaB by a membrane-associated kinase, and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We apply sensitivity analysis to the model. This identifies those parameters in this (IkappaB)/NF-kappaB signalling system (containing only induced IkappaBalpha isoform) that most affect the oscillatory concentration of nuclear NF-kappaB (in terms of both period and amplitude). The intention is to provide guidance on which proteins are likely to be most significant as drug targets or should be exploited for further, more detailed experiments. The sensitivity coefficients were found to be strongly dependent upon the magnitude of the parameter change studied, indicating the highly non-linear nature of the system. Of the 64 parameters in the model, only eight to nine exerted a major control on nuclear NF-kappaB oscillations, and each of these involved as reaction participants either the IkappaB kinase (IKK) or IkappaBalpha, directly. This means that the dominant dynamics of the pathway can be reflected, in addition to that of nuclear NF-kappaB itself, by just two of the other pathway variables. This is conveniently observed in a phase-plane plot.",

The system contains the enzymes S-acetyl coenzyme A synthetase, adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase, and converts ATP into AMP, then into ADP and finally back to ATP. L-Lactate dehydrogenase is added to the system to enable continuous monitoring of the progress of the reaction. The cycle cannot work when the only recycling substrate in the reaction medium is AMP. A mathematical model is proposed whose kinetic behavior has been analyzed both numerically by integration of the nonlinear differential equations describing the kinetics of the reactions involved, and analytically under steady-state conditions, with good agreement with the experimental results being obtained. The data obtained showed that there is a threshold value of the S-acetyl coenzyme A synthetase/adenylate kinase ratio, above which the cycle stops because all the recycling substrate has been accumulated as AMP, never reaching the steady state. In addition, the concept of adenylate energy charge has been applied to the system, obtaining the enabled values of the rate constants for a fixed adenylate energy charge value and vice versa.",

    "synopsis": "Bistability underlies basic biological phenomena, such as cell division, differentiation, cancer onset, and apoptosis. So far biologists identified two necessary conditions for bistability: positive feedback and ultrasensitivity.Biological systems are based upon elementary mono- and bimolecular chemical reactions. In order to definitely clarify all necessary conditions for bistability we here present the corresponding minimal system. According to our definition, it contains the minimal number of (i) reactants, (ii) reactions, and (iii) terms in the corresponding ordinary differential equations (decreasing importance from i-iii). The minimal bistable system contains two reactants and four irreversible reactions (three bimolecular, one monomolecular).We discuss the roles of the reactions with respect to the necessary conditions for bistability: two reactions comprise the positive feedback loop, a third reaction filters out small stimuli thus enabling a stable 'off' state, and the fourth reaction prevents explosions. We argue that prevention of explosion is a third general necessary condition for bistability, which is so far lacking discussion in the literature.Moreover, in addition to proving that in two-component systems three steady states are necessary for bistability (five for tristability, etc.), we also present a simple general method to design such systems: one just needs one production and three different degradation mechanisms (one production, five degradations for tristability, etc.). This helps modelling multistable systems and it is important for corresponding synthetic biology projects.The presented minimal bistable system finally clarifies the often discussed question for the necessary conditions for bistability. The three necessary conditions are: positive feedback, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions. This is important for modelling bistability with simple systems and for synthetically designing new bistable systems. Our simple model system is also well suited for corresponding teaching purposes.",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gemcitabine was given thrice weekly on days 1 and 8 in combination with carboplatin, which was given only on day 1 of every cycle. Gemcitabine amount in the body and area under the concentration-time curves of plasma gemcitabine, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, and intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate in white cells were compared to determine which best describes tumor shrinkage over time. Tumor growth kinetics were described using a Gompertz-like model. RESULTS: The apparent half-life for the effect of gemcitabine was 7.67 weeks. The tumor turnover time constant was 21.8 week.cm. Baseline tumor size and gemcitabine amount in the body to attain 50% of tumor shrinkage were estimated to be 6.66 cm and 10,600 mg. There was no evidence of relapse during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine and its metabolites were no better than gemcitabine amount in predicting tumor shrinkage in primary lung cancer lesions. Gemcitabine dose-based models did marginally better than treatment-based models that ignored doses of drug administered to patients. Modeling tumor shrinkage in primary lesions can be used to quantify individual sensitivity and response to antitumor effects of anticancer drugs.",

    "title": "Monte Carlo analysis of an ODE Model of the Sea Urchin Endomesoderm Network.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) control the differentiation, specification and function of cells at the genomic level. The levels of interactions within large GRNs are of enormous depth and complexity. Details about many GRNs are emerging, but in most cases it is unknown to what extent they control a given process, i.e. the grade of completeness is uncertain. This uncertainty stems from limited experimental data, which is the main bottleneck for creating detailed dynamical models of cellular processes. Parameter estimation for each node is often infeasible for very large GRNs. We propose a method, based on random parameter estimations through Monte-Carlo simulations to measure completeness grades of GRNs. RESULTS: We developed a heuristic to assess the completeness of large GRNs, using ODE simulations under different conditions and randomly sampled parameter sets to detect parameter-invariant effects of perturbations. To test this heuristic, we constructed the first ODE model of the whole sea urchin endomesoderm GRN, one of the best studied large GRNs. We find that nearly 48% of the parameter-invariant effects correspond with experimental data, which is 65% of the expected optimal agreement obtained from a submodel for which kinetic parameters were estimated and used for simulations. Randomized versions of the model reproduce only 23.5% of the experimental data. CONCLUSION: The method described in this paper enables an evaluation of network topologies of GRNs without requiring any parameter values. The benefit of this method is exemplified in the first mathematical analysis of the complete Endomesoderm Network Model. The predictions we provide deliver candidate nodes in the network that are likely to be erroneous or miss unknown connections, which may need additional experiments to improve the network topology. This mathematical model can serve as a scaffold for detailed and more realistic models. We propose that our method can be used to assess a completeness grade of any GRN. This could be especially useful for GRNs involved in human diseases, where often the amount of connectivity is unknown and/or many genes/interactions are missing.",

    "synopsis": "We have constructed a model of the upper part of the glycolysis in the pancreatic beta-cell. The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and/or GAPD activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and/or GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible. The theoretical results presented in this study apply to the study of insulin secretion mechanisms, since glycolytic oscillations have been proposed as a cause of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio which is linked to insulin secretion.",

    "synopsis": "Cells must be able to process multiple information in parallel and, moreover, they must also be able to combine this information in order to trigger the appropriate response. This is achieved by wiring signalling pathways such that they can interact with each other, a phenomenon often called crosstalk. In this study, we employ mathematical modelling techniques to analyse dynamic mechanisms and measures of crosstalk. We present a dynamic mathematical model that compiles current knowledge about the wiring of the pheromone pathway and the filamentous growth pathway in yeast. We consider the main dynamic features and the interconnections between the two pathways in order to study dynamic crosstalk between these two pathways in haploid cells. We introduce two new measures of dynamic crosstalk, the intrinsic specificity and the extrinsic specificity. These two measures incorporate the combined signal of several stimuli being present simultaneously and seem to be more stable than previous measures. When both pathways are responsive and stimulated, the model predicts that (a) the filamentous growth pathway amplifies the response of the pheromone pathway, and (b) the pheromone pathway inhibits the response of filamentous growth pathway in terms of mitogen activated protein kinase activity and transcriptional activity, respectively. Among several mechanisms we identified leakage of activated Ste11 as the most influential source of crosstalk. Moreover, we propose new experiments and predict their outcomes in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of crosstalk between the two pathways. Studying signals that are transmitted in parallel gives us new insights about how pathways and signals interact in a dynamical way, e.g., whether they amplify, inhibit, delay or accelerate each other.",

    "synopsis": "PURPOSE: To describe the pharmacodynamic effects of recombinant human interleukin-21 (IL-21) on core body temperature in cynomolgus monkeys using basic mechanisms of heat regulation. A major effort was devoted to compare the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. METHODS: A temperature model was formulated including circadian rhythm, metabolism, heat loss, and a thermoregulatory set-point. This model was formulated as a mixed-effects model based on SDEs using NONMEM. RESULTS: The effects of IL-21 were on the set-point and the circadian rhythm of metabolism. The model was able to describe a complex set of IL-21 induced phenomena, including 1) disappearance of the circadian rhythm, 2) no effect after first dose, and 3) high variability after second dose. SDEs provided a more realistic description with improved simulation properties, and further changed the model into one that could not be falsified by the autocorrelation function. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-21 induced effects on thermoregulation in cynomolgus monkeys are explained by a biologically plausible model. The quality of the model was improved by the use of SDEs.",

The model consists of 44 enzymatic reactions, 59 metabolic state variables, and 272 parameters. It integrates five subsystems: glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the respiratory chain, NADH shuttles, and the pyruvate cycle. It also takes into account compartmentalization of the reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix. The model shows expected behavior in its outputs, including the response of ATP production to starting glucose concentration and the induction of oscillations of metabolite concentrations in the glycolytic pathway and in ATP and ADP concentrations. Identification of choke points and parameter sensitivity analysis indicate that the glycolytic pathway, and to a lesser extent the TCA cycle, are critical to the proper behavior of the system, while parameters in other components such as the respiratory chain are less critical. Notably, however, sensitivity analysis identifies the first reactions of nonglycolytic pathways as being important for the behavior of the system. The model is robust to deletion of malic enzyme activity, which is absent in mouse pancreatic beta cells. The model represents a step toward the construction of a model with species-specific parameters that can be used to understand mouse models of diabetes and the relationship of these mouse models to the human disease state.",

    "synopsis": "The most sophisticated survival strategy Bacillus subtilis employs is the differentiation of a subpopulation of cells into highly resistant endospores. To examine the expression patterns of non-sporulating cells within heterogeneous populations, we used buoyant density centrifugation to separate vegetative cells from endospore-containing cells and compared the transcriptome profiles of both subpopulations. This demonstrated the differential expression of various regulons. Subsequent single-cell analyses using promoter-gfp fusions confirmed our microarray results. Surprisingly, only part of the vegetative subpopulation highly and transiently expresses genes encoding the extracellular proteases Bpr (bacillopeptidase) and AprE (subtilisin), both of which are under the control of the DegU transcriptional regulator. As these proteases and their degradation products freely diffuse within the liquid growth medium, all cells within the clonal population are expected to benefit from their activities, suggesting that B. subtilis employs cooperative or even altruistic behavior. To unravel the mechanisms by which protease production heterogeneity within the non-sporulating subpopulation is established, we performed a series of genetic experiments combined with mathematical modeling. Simulations with our model yield valuable insights into how population heterogeneity may arise by the relatively long and variable response times within the DegU autoactivating pathway.",

Our study in a small group of subjects indicates that acute tolerance develops to the pressor effect of caffeine and that both the pressor effect and tolerance occur after some time delay relative to changes in plasma caffeine concentration. The half-life of equilibration of effect with plasma caffeine concentration is about 20 minutes. The half-life of development and regression of tolerance is estimated to be about 1 hour, and the model suggests that tolerance, at its fullest, causes more than a 90% reduction of initial (nontolerant) effect. Whereas tolerance to the pressor effect of caffeine develops in habitual coffee drinkers, the pressor response is regained after relatively brief periods of abstinence. Because of the rapid development and regression of tolerance, the pressor response to caffeine depends on how much caffeine is consumed, the schedule of consumption, and the elimination half-life of caffeine.",

Mathematical analysis of this model predicts that a change in the proliferative status in response to a change in concentrations of serum growth factors will exhibit the property of hysteresis: the concentration of growth factors required to induce proliferation is higher than the concentration required to maintain proliferation. We experimentally confirmed this prediction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. In agreement with the mathematical model, this indicates that changes in proliferative mode caused by small changes in concentrations of growth factors are not easily reversible. Based on this study, we discuss the importance of proliferation hysteresis for cell cycle regulation.",

Systematic model reduction resulted in a surprisingly simple model well approximating experimentally observed dynamics. The model postulates a new link between c-FLIP(L) cleavage in the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and the NF-kappaB pathway. We validated experimentally that CD95 stimulation resulted in an interaction of p43-FLIP with the IKK complex followed by its activation. Furthermore, we showed that the apoptotic and NF-kappaB pathways diverge already at the DISC.

    "synopsis": "The recognition of carbon sources and the regulatory adjustments to recognized changes are of particular importance for bacterial survival in fluctuating environments. Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli's central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli's central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources.",

    "synopsis": "A biochemically structured model for the aerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on glucose and ethanol is presented. The model focuses on the pyruvate and acetaldehyde branch points where overflow metabolism occurs when the growth changes from oxidative to oxido-reductive. The model is designed to describe the onset of aerobic alcoholic fermentation during steady-state as well as under dynamical conditions, by triggering an increase in the glycolytic flux using a key signalling component which is assumed to be closely related to acetaldehyde. An investigation of the modelled process dynamics in a continuous cultivation revealed multiple steady states in a region of dilution rates around the transition between oxidative and oxido-reductive growth. A bifurcation analysis using the two external variables, the dilution rate, D, and the inlet concentration of glucose, S(f), as parameters, showed that a fold bifurcation occurs close to the critical dilution rate resulting in multiple steady-states. The region of dilution rates within which multiple steady states may occur depends strongly on the substrate feed concentration. Consequently a single steady state may prevail at low feed concentrations, whereas multiple steady states may occur over a relatively wide range of dilution rates at higher feed concentrations.",

    "synopsis": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is a multicellular system that drives daily rhythms in mammalian behavior and physiology. Although the gene regulatory network that produces daily oscillations within individual neurons is well characterized, less is known about the electrophysiology of the SCN cells and how firing rate correlates with circadian gene expression. We developed a firing rate code model to incorporate known electrophysiological properties of SCN pacemaker cells, including circadian dependent changes in membrane voltage and ion conductances. Calcium dynamics were included in the model as the putative link between electrical firing and gene expression. Individual ion currents exhibited oscillatory patterns matching experimental data both in current levels and phase relationships. VIP and GABA neurotransmitters, which encode synaptic signals across the SCN, were found to play critical roles in daily oscillations of membrane excitability and gene expression. Blocking various mechanisms of intracellular calcium accumulation by simulated pharmacological agents (nimodipine, IP3- and ryanodine-blockers) reproduced experimentally observed trends in firing rate dynamics and core-clock gene transcription. The intracellular calcium concentration was shown to regulate diverse circadian processes such as firing frequency, gene expression and system periodicity. The model predicted a direct relationship between firing frequency and gene expression amplitudes, demonstrated the importance of intracellular pathways for single cell behavior and provided a novel multiscale framework which captured characteristics of the SCN at both the electrophysiological and gene regulatory levels.",

    "synopsis": "Eukaryotic cells have evolved various response mechanisms to counteract the deleterious consequences of oxidative stress. Among these processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role.We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux.The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions.",

Invasive and non-invasive experimental approaches have been used to elucidate mechanisms regulating the balance between oxygen supply and consumption during exercise. Such approaches suggest that the mechanism controlling the various subsystems coupling internal to external respiration are part of a highly redundant and hierarchical multi-scale system. In this work, we present a \"systems biology\" framework that integrates experimental and theoretical approaches able to provide simultaneously reliable information on the oxygen transport and utilization processes occurring at the various steps in the pathway of oxygen from air to mitochondria, particularly at the onset of exercise. This multi-disciplinary framework provides insights into the relationship between cellular oxygen consumption derived from measurements of muscle oxygenation during exercise and pulmonary oxygen uptake by indirect calorimetry. With a validated model, muscle oxygen dynamic responses is simulated and quantitatively related to cellular metabolism under a variety of conditions.",

    "synopsis": "Models for the diversity and evolution of pathogens have branched into two main directions: the adaptive dynamics of quantitative life-history traits (notably virulence) and the maintenance and invasion of multiple, antigenically diverse strains that interact with the host's immune memory. In a first attempt to reconcile these two approaches, we developed a simple modelling framework where two strains of pathogens, defined by a pair of life-history traits (infectious period and infectivity), interfere through a given level of cross-immunity. We used whooping cough as a potential example, but the framework proposed here could be applied to other acute infectious diseases. Specifically, we analysed the effects of these parameters on the invasion dynamics of one strain into a population, where the second strain is endemic. Whereas the deterministic version of the model converges towards stable coexistence of the two strains in most cases, stochastic simulations showed that transient epidemic dynamics can cause the extinction of either strain. Thus ecological dynamics, modulated by the immune parameters, eventually determine the adaptive value of different pathogen genotypes. We advocate an integrative view of pathogen dynamics at the crossroads of immunology, epidemiology and evolution, as a way towards efficient control of infectious diseases.",

It can trigger cellular senescence, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to diverse stress conditions, including DNA damage, hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Signals from all these inputs are channeled through a single node, the transcription factor p53. Yet, the pathway is flexible enough to produce different downstream gene expression patterns in response to different stresses.We construct a mathematical model of the negative feedback loop involving p53 and its inhibitor, Mdm2, at the core of this pathway, and use it to examine the effect of different stresses that trigger p53. In response to DNA damage, hypoxia, etc., the model exhibits a wide variety of specific output behaviour - steady states with low or high levels of p53 and Mdm2, as well as spiky oscillations with low or high average p53 levels.We show that even a simple negative feedback loop is capable of exhibiting the kind of flexible stress-specific response observed in the p53 system. Further, our model provides a framework for predicting the differences in p53 response to different stresses and single nucleotide polymorphisms.",

This is illustrated by a detailed kinetic analysis of a paradoxical Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant; the mutant fails to grow on glucose because of overactive initial enzymes of glycolysis, but is defective only in an enzyme (trehalose 6-phosphate synthase) that appears to have little relevance to glycolysis. The ubiquity of pathways that possess an initial activation step, suggests that there might be many more genes that, when deleted, cause rather paradoxical regulation phenotypes (i.e. growth defects caused by enhanced utilization of growth substrate).",

Under certain conditions the concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates in yeast cells can oscillate. Individual yeast cells in a suspension can synchronize their oscillations to get in phase with each other. Although the glycolytic oscillations originate in the upper part of the glycolytic chain, the signaling agent in this synchronization appears to be acetaldehyde, a membrane-permeating metabolite at the bottom of the anaerobic part of the glycolytic chain. Here we address the issue of how a metabolite remote from the pacemaking origin of the oscillation may nevertheless control the synchronization. We present a quantitative model for glycolytic oscillations and their synchronization in terms of chemical kinetics. We show that, in essence, the common acetaldehyde concentration can be modeled as a small perturbation on the \"pacemaker\" whose effect on the period of the oscillations of cells in the same suspension is indeed such that a synchronization develops.",

    "synopsis": "The ErbB signaling pathways, which regulate diverse physiological responses such as cell survival, proliferation and motility, have been subjected to extensive molecular analysis. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood how different ligands induce different responses and how this is affected by oncogenic mutations. To quantify signal flow through ErbB-activated pathways we have constructed, trained and analyzed a mass action model of immediate-early signaling involving ErbB1-4 receptors (EGFR, HER2/Neu2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt cascades. We find that parameter sensitivity is strongly dependent on the feature (e.g. ERK or Akt activation) or condition (e.g. EGF or heregulin stimulation) under examination and that this context dependence is informative with respect to mechanisms of signal propagation. Modeling predicts log-linear amplification so that significant ERK and Akt activation is observed at ligand concentrations far below the K(d) for receptor binding. However, MAPK and Akt modules isolated from the ErbB model continue to exhibit switch-like responses. Thus, key system-wide features of ErbB signaling arise from nonlinear interaction among signaling elements, the properties of which appear quite different in context and in isolation.",

Single-cell imaging studies have demonstrated that this process may occur as a rapid, all-or-none response, triggering a complete substrate cleavage within 15 min. Based on biochemical data from HeLa cells, we have developed a computational model of apoptosome-dependent caspase activation that was sufficient to remodel the rapid kinetics of effector caspase activation observed in vivo. Sensitivity analyses predicted a critical role for caspase-3-dependent feedback signalling and the X-linked-inhibitor-of-apoptosis-protein (XIAP), but a less prominent role for the XIAP antagonist Smac. Single-cell experiments employing a caspase fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate verified these model predictions qualitatively and quantitatively. XIAP was predicted to control this all-or-none response, with concentrations as high as 0.15 microM enabling, but concentrations >0.30 microM significantly blocking substrate cleavage. Overexpression of XIAP within these threshold concentrations produced cells showing slow effector caspase activation and submaximal substrate cleavage. Our study supports the hypothesis that high levels of XIAP control caspase activation and substrate cleavage, and may promote apoptosis resistance and sublethal caspase activation in vivo.",

We show here that a simple (M,R)-system consisting of three interlocking catalytic cycles, with every catalyst produced by the system itself, can both establish a non-trivial steady state and maintain this despite continuous loss of the catalysts by irreversible degradation. As long as at least one catalyst is present at a sufficient concentration in the initial state, the others can be produced and maintained. The system shows bistability, because if the amount of catalyst in the initial state is insufficient to reach the non-trivial steady state the system collapses to a trivial steady state in which all fluxes are zero. It is also robust, because if one catalyst is catastrophically lost when the system is in steady state it can recreate the same state. There are three elementary flux modes, but none of them is an enzyme-maintaining mode, the entire network being necessary to maintain the two catalysts.",

    "synopsis": "Previous studies have suggested that positive feedback loops and ultrasensitivity are prerequisites for bistability in covalent modification cascades. However, it was recently shown that bistability and hysteresis can also arise solely from multisite phosphorylation. Here we analytically demonstrate that double phosphorylation of a protein (or other covalent modification) generates bistability only if: (a) the two phosphorylation (or the two dephosphorylation) reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme; (b) the kinetics operate at least partly in the zero-order region; and (c) the ratio of the catalytic constants of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps in the first modification cycle is less than this ratio in the second cycle. We also show that multisite phosphorylation enlarges the region of kinetic parameter values in which bistability appears, but does not generate multistability. In addition, we conclude that a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles generates multiple steady states in the absence of feedback or feedforward loops. Our results show that bistable behavior in covalent modification cascades relies not only on the structure and regulatory pattern of feedback/feedforward loops, but also on the kinetic characteristics of their component proteins.",

    "title": "Systems analysis of iron metabolism: the network of iron pools and fluxes.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Every cell of the mammalian organism needs iron as trace element in numerous oxido-reductive processes as well as for transport and storage of oxygen. The very versatility of ionic iron makes it a toxic entity which can catalyze the production of radicals that damage vital membranous and macromolecular assemblies in the cell. The mammalian organism maintains therefore a complex regulatory network of iron uptake, excretion and intra-body distribution. Intracellular regulation in different cell types is intertwined with a global hormonal signalling structure. Iron deficiency as well as excess of iron are frequent and serious human disorders. They can affect every cell, but also the organism as a whole. RESULTS: Here, we present a kinematic model of the dynamic system of iron pools and fluxes. It is based on ferrokinetic data and chemical measurements in C57BL6 wild-type mice maintained on iron-deficient, iron-adequate, or iron-loaded diet. The tracer iron levels in major tissues and organs (16 compartment) were followed for 28 days. The evaluation resulted in a whole-body model of fractional clearance rates. The analysis permits calculation of absolute flux rates in the steady-state, of iron distribution into different organs, of tracer-accessible pool sizes and of residence times of iron in the different compartments in response to three states of iron-repletion induced by the dietary regime. CONCLUSIONS: This mathematical model presents a comprehensive physiological picture of mice under three different diets with varying iron contents. The quantitative results reflect systemic properties of iron metabolism: dynamic closedness, hierarchy of time scales, switch-over response and dynamics of iron storage in parenchymal organs. Therefore, we could assess which parameters will change under dietary perturbations and study in quantitative terms when those changes take place.",

    "title": "Restriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex.",
    "synopsis": "Numerous top-down kinetic models have been constructed to describe the cell cycle. These models have typically been constructed, validated and analyzed using model species (molecular intermediates and proteins) and phenotypic observations, and therefore do not focus on the individual model processes (reaction steps). We have developed a method to: (a) quantify the importance of each of the reaction steps in a kinetic model for the positioning of a switch point [i.e. the restriction point (RP)]; (b) relate this control of reaction steps to their effects on molecular species, using sensitivity and co-control analysis; and thereby (c) go beyond a correlation towards a causal relationship between molecular species and effects. The method is generic and can be applied to responses of any type, but is most useful for the analysis of dynamic and emergent responses such as switch points in the cell cycle. The strength of the analysis is illustrated for an existing mammalian cell cycle model focusing on the RP [Novak B, Tyson J (2004) J Theor Biol230, 563-579]. The reactions in the model with the highest RP control were those involved in: (a) the interplay between retinoblastoma protein and E2F transcription factor; (b) those synthesizing the delayed response genes and cyclin D/Cdk4 in response to growth signals; (c) the E2F-dependent cyclin E/Cdk2 synthesis reaction; as well as (d) p27 formation reactions. Nine of the 23 intermediates were shown to have a good correlation between their concentration control and RP control. Sensitivity and co-control analysis indicated that the strongest control of the RP is mediated via the cyclin E/Cdk2:p27 complex concentration. Any perturbation of the RP could be related to a change in the concentration of this complex; apparent effects of other molecular species were indirect and always worked through cyclin E/Cdk2:p27, indicating a causal relationship between this complex and the positioning of the RP.",

    "title": "Biochemical and genomic regulation of the trehalose cycle in yeast: review of observations and canonical model analysis.",
    "synopsis": "The physiological hallmark of heat-shock response in yeast is a rapid, enormous increase in the concentration of trehalose. Normally found in growing yeast cells and other organisms only as traces, trehalose becomes a crucial protector of proteins and membranes against a variety of stresses, including heat, cold, starvation, desiccation, osmotic or oxidative stress, and exposure to toxicants. Trehalose is produced from glucose 6-phosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose in a two-step process, and recycled to glucose by trehalases. Even though the trehalose cycle consists of only a few metabolites and enzymatic steps, its regulatory structure and operation are surprisingly complex. The article begins with a review of experimental observations on the regulation of the trehalose cycle in yeast and proposes a canonical model for its analysis. The first part of this analysis demonstrates the benefits of the various regulatory features by means of controlled comparisons with models of otherwise equivalent pathways lacking these features. The second part elucidates the significance of the expression pattern of the trehalose cycle genes in response to heat shock. Interestingly, the genes contributing to trehalose formation are up-regulated to very different degrees, and even the trehalose degrading trehalases show drastically increased activity during heat-shock response. Again using the method of controlled comparisons, the model provides rationale for the observed pattern of gene expression and reveals benefits of the counterintuitive trehalase up-regulation.",

    "title": "Onset dynamics of type A botulinum neurotoxin-induced paralysis.",
    "synopsis": "Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, BoNT/A is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking protein, SNAP-25, to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis of skeletal muscles induced by BoNT/A at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of coupled, first-order differential equations. In this study, the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 212:16-21,1980) was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other impermeable inhibitors of BoNT/A can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for BoNT/A binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin concentrations, a new BoNT/A species and rate (k(S)) were added at the beginning of the reaction sequence to create a 4-step scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate determined by k(S) to a free species that is capable of binding. By systematically adjusting the values of k(S), the 4-step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function (k(S) >or= 0.01), the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice following i.m. injections (k (S) = 0.001), and the slow onset of the therapeutic effects of BoNT/A (k(S) < 0.001) in man. This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by simulating experimental results, it helped to quantitatively define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect (t(inhib)) and the relation between this time and the rate of paralysis onset. The 4-step model predicted that as the rate of paralysis becomes slower, the estimated upper limits of (t(inhib)) for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More generally, this modeling approach may be useful in studying the kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by similar mechanisms, e.g., receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

    "synopsis": "Glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in anti-oxidant defense and detoxification reactions. It is primarily synthesized in the liver by the transsulfuration pathway and exported to provide precursors for in situ GSH synthesis by other tissues. Deficits in glutathione have been implicated in aging and a host of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, Down syndrome and autism.We explore the properties of glutathione metabolism in the liver by experimenting with a mathematical model of one-carbon metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway, and glutathione synthesis, transport, and breakdown. The model is based on known properties of the enzymes and the regulation of those enzymes by oxidative stress. We explore the half-life of glutathione, the regulation of glutathione synthesis, and its sensitivity to fluctuations in amino acid input. We use the model to simulate the metabolic profiles previously observed in Down syndrome and autism and compare the model results to clinical data.We show that the glutathione pools in hepatic cells and in the blood are quite insensitive to fluctuations in amino acid input and offer an explanation based on model predictions. In contrast, we show that hepatic glutathione pools are highly sensitive to the level of oxidative stress. The model shows that overexpression of genes on chromosome 21 and an increase in oxidative stress can explain the metabolic profile of Down syndrome. The model also correctly simulates the metabolic profile of autism when oxidative stress is substantially increased and the adenosine concentration is raised. Finally, we discuss how individual variation arises and its consequences for one-carbon and glutathione metabolism.",

    "synopsis": "An important question in plant biology is how genes influence the crosstalk between hormones to regulate growth. In this study, we model POLARIS (PLS) gene function and crosstalk between auxin, ethylene and cytokinin in Arabidopsis. Experimental evidence suggests that PLS acts on or close to the ethylene receptor ETR1, and a mathematical model describing possible PLS-ethylene pathway interactions is developed, and used to make quantitative predictions about PLS-hormone interactions. Modelling correctly predicts experimental results for the effect of the pls gene mutation on endogenous cytokinin concentration. Modelling also reveals a role for PLS in auxin biosynthesis in addition to a role in auxin transport. The model reproduces available mutants, and with new experimental data provides new insights into how PLS regulates auxin concentration, by controlling the relative contribution of auxin transport and biosynthesis and by integrating auxin, ethylene and cytokinin signalling. Modelling further reveals that a bell-shaped dose-response relationship between endogenous auxin and root length is established via PLS. This combined modelling and experimental analysis provides new insights into the integration of hormonal signals in plants.",

By combining quantitative data from erythropoietin-induced pathway activation in primary erythroid progenitor (colony-forming unit erythroid stage, CFU-E) cells with mathematical modelling, we predicted and experimentally confirmed a distributive ERK phosphorylation mechanism in CFU-E cells. Model analysis showed bow-tie-shaped signal processing and inherently transient signalling for cytokine-induced ERK signalling. Sensitivity analysis predicted that, through a feedback-mediated process, increasing one ERK isoform reduces activation of the other isoform, which was verified by protein over-expression. We calculated ERK activation for biochemically not addressable but physiologically relevant ligand concentrations showing that double-phosphorylated ERK1 attenuates proliferation beyond a certain activation level, whereas activated ERK2 enhances proliferation with saturation kinetics. Thus, we provide a quantitative link between earlier unobservable signalling dynamics and cell fate decisions.",

Multiple biological components can contribute to each part of the circuit in higher organisms. Mechanistic models with morning, evening and central feedback loops have provided a heuristic framework for the clock in plants, but were based on transcriptional control. Here, we model observed, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation and constrain many parameter values based on experimental data. The model's feedback circuit is revised and now includes PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) and ZEITLUPE. The revised model matches data in varying environments and mutants, and gains robustness to parameter variation. Our results suggest that the activation of important morning-expressed genes follows their release from a night inhibitor (NI). Experiments inspired by the new model support the predicted NI function and show that the PRR5 gene contributes to the NI. The multiple PRR genes of Arabidopsis uncouple events in the late night from light-driven responses in the day, increasing the flexibility of rhythmic regulation.",

    "title": "Modeling of bone formation and resorption mediated by parathyroid hormone: response to estrogen/PTH therapy.",
    "synopsis": "Bone, a major reservoir of body calcium, is under the hormonal control of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). Several aspects of its growth, turnover, and mechanism, occur in the absence of gonadal hormones. Sex steroids such as estrogen, nonetheless, play an important role in bone physiology, and are extremely essential to maintain bone balance in adults. In order to provide a basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of bone remodeling as it is mediated by PTH, we propose here a mathematical model of the process. The nonlinear system model is then utilized to study the temporal effect of PTH as well as the action of estrogen replacement therapy on bone turnover. Analysis of the model is done on the assumption, supported by reported clinical evidence, that the process is characterized by highly diversified dynamics, which warrants the use of singular perturbation arguments. The model is shown to exhibit limit cycle behavior, which can develop into chaotic dynamics for certain ranges of the system's parametric values. Effects of estrogen and PTH administrations are then investigated by extending on the core model. Analysis of the model seems to indicate that the paradoxical observation that intermittent PTH administration causes net bone deposition while continuous administration causes net bone loss, and certain other reported phenomena may be attributed to the highly diversified dynamics which characterizes this nonlinear remodeling process.",

    "synopsis": "The establishment of thresholds along morphogen gradients in the embryo is poorly understood. Using mathematical modeling, we show that mutually inhibitory gradients can generate and position sharp morphogen thresholds in the embryonic space. Taking vertebrate segmentation as a paradigm, we demonstrate that the antagonistic gradients of retinoic acid (RA) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) along the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) may lead to the coexistence of two stable steady states. Here, we propose that this bistability is associated with abrupt switches in the levels of FGF and RA signaling, which permit the synchronized activation of segmentation genes, such as mesp2, in successive cohorts of PSM cells in response to the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Bistability resulting from mutual inhibition of RA and FGF provides a molecular mechanism for the all-or-none transitions assumed in the \"clock and wavefront\" somitogenesis model. Given that mutually antagonistic signaling gradients are common in development, such bistable switches could represent an important principle underlying embryonic patterning.",

    "title": "Modeling the interactions between osteoblast and osteoclast activities in bone remodeling.",
    "synopsis": "We propose a mathematical model explaining the interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, two cell types specialized in the maintenance of the bone integrity. Bone is a dynamic, living tissue whose structure and shape continuously evolves during life. It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that the relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In addition, osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary understanding, we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have simulated, including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of PTH, the catabolic action of RANKL, as well as its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, senescence and glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone loss, whereas bone formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In particular, the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with monotherapy, especially for certain type of skeletal disease. Finally, the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of the pool of preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.",

    "title": "Mathematical model of paracrine interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts predicts anabolic action of parathyroid hormone on bone.",
    "synopsis": "To restore falling plasma calcium levels, PTH promotes calcium liberation from bone. PTH targets bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, to increase expression of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), which then stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. Intriguingly, whereas continuous administration of PTH decreases bone mass, intermittent PTH has an anabolic effect on bone, which was proposed to arise from direct effects of PTH on osteoblastic bone formation. However, antiresorptive therapies impair the ability of PTH to increase bone mass, indicating a complex role for osteoclasts in the process. We developed a mathematical model that describes the actions of PTH at a single site of bone remodeling, where osteoclasts and osteoblasts are regulated by local autocrine and paracrine factors. It was assumed that PTH acts only to increase the production of RANKL by osteoblasts. As a result, PTH stimulated osteoclasts upon application, followed by compensatory osteoblast activation due to the coupling of osteoblasts to osteoclasts through local paracrine factors. Continuous PTH administration resulted in net bone loss, because bone resorption preceded bone formation at all times. In contrast, over a wide range of model parameters, short application of PTH resulted in a net increase in bone mass, because osteoclasts were rapidly removed upon PTH withdrawal, enabling osteoblasts to rebuild the bone. In excellent agreement with experimental findings, increase in the rate of osteoclast death abolished the anabolic effect of PTH on bone. This study presents an original concept for the regulation of bone remodeling by PTH, currently the only approved anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.",

    "synopsis": "Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.",

The equilibrium constant of peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide has a minimum value of 2 x 10(-8). 2. The velocity constant for the formation of peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I is 1.2 x 10(7) liter mole-1 sec.-1, +/- 0.4 x 10(7). 3. The velocity constant for the reversible breakdown of peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I is a negligible factor in the enzyme-substrate kinetics and is calculated to be less than 0.2 sec.-1. 4. The velocity constant, k3, for the enzymatic breakdown of peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I varies from nearly zero to higher than 5 sec.-1, depending upon the acceptor and its concentration. The quotient of k3 and the leucomalachite green concentration is 3.0 x 10(4) liter mole-1 sec.-1. For ascorbic acid this has a value of 1.8 x 10(5) liter mole-1 sec.-1. 5. For a particular acceptor concentration, k3 is determined solely from the enzyme-substrate kinetics and is found to be 4.2 sec.-1. 6. For the same conditions, k3 is determined from a simple relationship derived from mathematical solutions of the Michaelis theory and is found to be 5.2 sec.-1. 7. For the same conditions, k3 is determined from the over-all enzyme action and is found to be 5.1 sec.-1. 8. The Michaelis constant determined from kinetic data alone is found to be 0.44 x 10(-6). 9. The Michaelis constant determined from steady state measurements is found to be 0.41 x 10(-6). 10. The Michaelis constant determined from measurement of the overall enzyme reaction is found to be 0.50 x 10(-6). 11. The kinetics of the enzyme-substrate compound closely agree with mathematical solutions of an extension of the Michaelis theory obtained for experimental values of concentrations and reaction velocity constants. 12. The adequacy of the criteria by which experiment and theory were correlated has been examined critically and the mathematical solutions have been found to be sensitive to variations in the experimental conditions. 13. The critical features of the enzyme-substrate kinetics are Pmax, and curve shape, rather than t1/2. t1/2 serves as a simple measure of dx/dt. 14. A second order combination of enzyme and substrate to form the enzyme-substrate compound, followed by a first order breakdown of the compound, describes the activity of peroxidase for a particular acceptor concentration. 15.

    "synopsis": "Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins are known to be the causative agents of a number of human neurodegenerative diseases but the molecular basis of their cytoxicity is still poorly understood. PolyQ tracts may impede the activity of the proteasome, and evidence from single cell imaging suggests that the sequestration of polyQ into inclusion bodies can reduce the proteasomal burden and promote cell survival, at least in the short term. The presence of misfolded protein also leads to activation of stress kinases such as p38MAPK, which can be cytotoxic. The relationships of these systems are not well understood. We have used fluorescent reporter systems imaged in living cells, and stochastic computer modeling to explore the relationships of polyQ, p38MAPK activation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteasome inhibition, and inclusion body formation. In cells expressing a polyQ protein inclusion, body formation was preceded by proteasome inhibition but cytotoxicity was greatly reduced by administration of a p38MAPK inhibitor. Computer simulations suggested that without the generation of ROS, the proteasome inhibition and activation of p38MAPK would have significantly reduced toxicity. Our data suggest a vicious cycle of stress kinase activation and proteasome inhibition that is ultimately lethal to cells. There was close agreement between experimental data and the predictions of a stochastic computer model, supporting a central role for proteasome inhibition and p38MAPK activation in inclusion body formation and ROS-mediated cell death.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) is implicated in both sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. The transcription factor, p53 also plays a role and has been linked to an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation although the effect is indirect. There is also evidence that GSK3beta and p53 interact and that the activity of both proteins is increased as a result of this interaction. Under normal cellular conditions, p53 is kept at low levels by Mdm2 but when cells are stressed, p53 is stabilised and may then interact with GSK3beta. We propose that this interaction has an important contribution to cellular outcomes and to test this hypothesis we developed a stochastic simulation model. RESULTS: The model predicts that high levels of DNA damage leads to increased activity of p53 and GSK3beta and low levels of aggregation but if DNA damage is repaired, the aggregates are eventually cleared. The model also shows that over long periods of time, aggregates may start to form due to stochastic events leading to increased levels of ROS and damaged DNA. This is followed by increased activity of p53 and GSK3beta and a vicious cycle ensues. CONCLUSIONS: Since p53 and GSK3beta are both involved in the apoptotic pathway, and GSK3beta overactivity leads to increased levels of plaques and tangles, our model might explain the link between protein aggregation and neuronal loss in neurodegeneration.",

    "synopsis": "Cellular senescence--the permanent arrest of cycling in normally proliferating cells such as fibroblasts--contributes both to age-related loss of mammalian tissue homeostasis and acts as a tumour suppressor mechanism. The pathways leading to establishment of senescence are proving to be more complex than was previously envisaged. Combining in-silico interactome analysis and functional target gene inhibition, stochastic modelling and live cell microscopy, we show here that there exists a dynamic feedback loop that is triggered by a DNA damage response (DDR) and, which after a delay of several days, locks the cell into an actively maintained state of 'deep' cellular senescence. The essential feature of the loop is that long-term activation of the checkpoint gene CDKN1A (p21) induces mitochondrial dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through serial signalling through GADD45-MAPK14(p38MAPK)-GRB2-TGFBR2-TGFbeta. These ROS in turn replenish short-lived DNA damage foci and maintain an ongoing DDR. We show that this loop is both necessary and sufficient for the stability of growth arrest during the establishment of the senescent phenotype.",

Through quantitative measurements that systematically canvas an array of stimulation and molecular perturbation conditions, together with computational modeling and analysis, we have elucidated cross-talk mechanisms in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling network, in which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are prominently activated. We show that, while PI3K signaling is insulated from cross-talk, PI3K enhances Erk activation at points both upstream and downstream of Ras. The magnitudes of these effects depend strongly on the stimulation conditions, subject to saturation effects in the respective pathways and negative feedback loops. Motivated by those dynamics, a kinetic model of the network was formulated and used to precisely quantify the relative contributions of PI3K-dependent and -independent modes of Ras/Erk activation.",

    "title": "Self-tolerance and autoimmunity in a regulatory T cell model.",
    "synopsis": "The class of immunosuppressive lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been identified as a key component in preventing autoimmune diseases. Although Tregs have been incorporated previously in mathematical models of autoimmunity, we take a novel approach which emphasizes the importance of professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs). We examine three possible mechanisms of Treg action (each in isolation) through ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The immune response against a particular autoantigen is suppressed both by Tregs specific for that antigen and by Tregs of arbitrary specificities, through their action on either maturing or already mature pAPCs or on autoreactive effector T cells. In this deterministic approach, we find that qualitative long-term behaviour is predicted by the basic reproductive ratio R(0) for each system. When R(0)<1, only the trivial equilibrium exists and is stable; when R(0)>1, this equilibrium loses its stability and a stable non-trivial equilibrium appears. We interpret the absence of self-damaging populations at the trivial equilibrium to imply a state of self-tolerance, and their presence at the non-trivial equilibrium to imply a state of chronic autoimmunity. Irrespective of mechanism, our model predicts that Tregs specific for the autoantigen in question play no role in the system's qualitative long-term behaviour, but have quantitative effects that could potentially reduce an autoimmune response to sub-clinical levels.

    "synopsis": "The class of immunosuppressive lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been identified as a key component in preventing autoimmune diseases. Although Tregs have been incorporated previously in mathematical models of autoimmunity, we take a novel approach which emphasizes the importance of professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs). We examine three possible mechanisms of Treg action (each in isolation) through ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The immune response against a particular autoantigen is suppressed both by Tregs specific for that antigen and by Tregs of arbitrary specificities, through their action on either maturing or already mature pAPCs or on autoreactive effector T cells. In this deterministic approach, we find that qualitative long-term behaviour is predicted by the basic reproductive ratio R(0) for each system. When R(0)<1, only the trivial equilibrium exists and is stable; when R(0)>1, this equilibrium loses its stability and a stable non-trivial equilibrium appears. We interpret the absence of self-damaging populations at the trivial equilibrium to imply a state of self-tolerance, and their presence at the non-trivial equilibrium to imply a state of chronic autoimmunity. Irrespective of mechanism, our model predicts that Tregs specific for the autoantigen in question play no role in the system's qualitative long-term behaviour, but have quantitative effects that could potentially reduce an autoimmune response to sub-clinical levels. Our results also suggest an important role for Tregs of arbitrary specificities in modulating the qualitative outcome. A stochastic treatment of the same model demonstrates that the probability of developing a chronic autoimmune response increases with the initial exposure to self antigen or autoreactive effector T cells. The three different mechanisms we consider, while leading to a number of similar predictions, also exhibit key differences in both transient dynamics (ODE approach) and the probability of chronic autoimmunity (stochastic approach).",

    "synopsis": "A simple mathematical model of photosynthetic carbon metabolism as driven by ATP and NADPH has been formulated to analyse photosynthetic oscillations. Two essential assumptions of this model are: (i) reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate to triosephosphate in the Clavin cycle is limited by ATP, not by NADPH, and (ii) photophosphorylation is affected by the availability of both ADP and NADP, while electron transport is limited by NADP only. The model produces oscillations of observed damping and period in ATP and NADP concentrations which are about 180 degrees out of phase, while three alternative proposals regarding coupling of electron transport and photophosphorylation do not produce oscillatory model solutions. The phases of ATP and NADPH are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data. The model (which assumes that redox control of photophosphorylation is part of the oscillatory mechanism) is compared with an alternative proposal (that oscillations are due to interdependence of turnover of adenylates and Calvin cycle intermediates). From the similarity of the mathematical structures of both models it is inviting to speculate that both models are partial aspects of 'the oscillatory mechanism'.",

    "synopsis": "Overexpression of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L1 leads to inclusion formation in response to proteasome impairment. These inclusions contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and \u03b1-synuclein confirming that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in protein aggregation. The processes involved are very complex and so we have chosen to take a systems biology approach to examine the system whereby we combine mathematical modelling with experiments in an iterative process. The experiments show that cells are very heterogeneous with respect to inclusion formation and so we use stochastic simulation. The model shows that the variability is partly due to stochastic effects but also depends on protein expression levels of UCH-L1 within cells. The model also indicates that the aggregation process can start even before any proteasome inhibition is present, but that proteasome inhibition greatly accelerates aggregation progression. This leads to less efficient protein degradation and hence more aggregation suggesting that there is a vicious cycle. However, proteasome inhibition may not necessarily be the initiating event. Our combined modelling and experimental approach show that stochastic effects play an important role in the aggregation process and could explain the variability in the age of disease onset. Furthermore, our model provides a valuable tool, as it can be easily modified and extended to incorporate new experimental data, test hypotheses and make testable predictions.",

We propose a simple mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of a novel pathogenic strain that emerges in a population where a previous strain is maintained at low endemic level by a vaccine. We compare three methods to assess the ability of the novel strain to invade and persist: algebraic rate of invasion; deterministic dynamics; and stochastic dynamics. These three techniques provide complementary predictions on the fate of the system. In particular, we emphasize the importance of stochastic simulations, which account for the possibility of extinctions of either strain. More specifically, our model suggests that the probability of persistence of an invasive strain (i) can be minimized for intermediate levels of vaccine cross-protection (i.e. immune protection against the novel strain) and (ii) is lower if cross-immunity acts through a reduced infectious period rather than through reduced susceptibility.",

    "synopsis": "A striking and defining feature of circadian clocks is the small variation in period over a physiological range of temperatures. This is referred to as temperature compensation, although recent work has suggested that the variation observed is a specific, adaptive control of period. Moreover, given that many biological rate constants have a Q(10) of around 2, it is remarkable that such clocks remain rhythmic under significant temperature changes. We introduce a new mathematical model for the Neurospora crassa circadian network incorporating experimental work showing that temperature alters the balance of translation between a short and long form of the FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein. This is used to discuss period control and functionality for the Neurospora system. The model reproduces a broad range of key experimental data on temperature dependence and rhythmicity, both in wild-type and mutant strains. We present a simple mechanism utilising the presence of the FRQ isoforms (isoform switching) by which period control could have evolved, and argue that this regulatory structure may also increase the temperature range where the clock is robustly rhythmic.",

Our synthetic ecosystem resembles canonical predator-prey systems in terms of logic and dynamics. The predator cells kill the prey by inducing expression of a killer protein in the prey, while the prey rescue the predators by eliciting expression of an antidote protein in the predator. Extinction, coexistence and oscillatory dynamics of the predator and prey populations are possible depending on the operating conditions as experimentally validated by long-term culturing of the system in microchemostats. A simple mathematical model is developed to capture these system dynamics. Coherent interplay between experiments and mathematical analysis enables exploration of the dynamics of interacting populations in a predictable manner.",

We propose a molecular network for Swe1 control, based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity. The model supports the idea that the morphogenesis checkpoint, like other checkpoints, raises the cell size threshold for progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next.",

For Drosophila, the molecular model is based on the negative feedback exerted on the expression of the per and tim genes by the complex formed between the PER and TIM proteins. For Neurospora, similarly, the model relies on the feedback exerted on the expression of the frq gene by its protein product FRQ. In both models, sustained rhythmic variations in protein and mRNA levels occur in continuous darkness, in the form of limit cycle oscillations. The effect of light on circadian rhythms is taken into account in the models by considering that it triggers degradation of the TIM protein in Drosophila, and frq transcription in Neurospora. When incorporating the control exerted by light at the molecular level, we show that the models can account for the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light-dark cycles and for the damping of the oscillations in constant light, though such damping occurs more readily in the Drosophila model. The models account for the phase shifts induced by light pulses and allow the construction of phase response curves. These compare well with experimental results obtained in Drosophila. The model for Drosophila shows that when applied at the appropriate phase, light pulses of appropriate duration and magnitude can permanently or transiently suppress circadian rhythmicity.

    "title": "Hypoxia-dependent sequestration of an oxygen sensor by a widespread structural motif can shape the hypoxic response--a predictive kinetic model.",
    "synopsis": "The activity of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is regulated by the post-translational, oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of its \u03b1-subunit by members of the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD or EGLN)-family and by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). PHD-dependent hydroxylation targets HIF\u03b1 for rapid proteasomal degradation; FIH-catalysed asparaginyl-hydroxylation of the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) of HIF\u03b1 suppresses the CAD-dependent subset of the extensive transcriptional responses induced by HIF. FIH can also hydroxylate ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD) proteins, a large group of proteins which are functionally unrelated but share common structural features. Competition by ARD proteins for FIH is hypothesised to affect FIH activity towards HIF\u03b1; however the extent of this competition and its effect on the HIF-dependent hypoxic response are unknown.To analyse if and in which way the FIH/ARD protein interaction affects HIF-activity, we created a rate equation model. Our model predicts that an oxygen-regulated sequestration of FIH by ARD proteins significantly shapes the input/output characteristics of the HIF system. The FIH/ARD protein interaction is predicted to create an oxygen threshold for HIF\u03b1 CAD-hydroxylation and to significantly sharpen the signal/response curves, which not only focuses HIF\u03b1 CAD-hydroxylation into a defined range of oxygen tensions, but also makes the response ultrasensitive to varying oxygen tensions. Our model further suggests that the hydroxylation status of the ARD protein pool can encode the strength and the duration of a hypoxic episode, which may allow cells to memorise these features for a certain time period after reoxygenation.The FIH/ARD protein interaction has the potential to contribute to oxygen-range finding, can sensitise the response to changes in oxygen levels, and can provide a memory of the strength and the duration of a hypoxic episode. These emergent properties are predicted to significantly shape the characteristics of HIF activity in animal cells. We argue that the FIH/ARD interaction should be taken into account in studies of the effect of pharmacological inhibition of the HIF-hydroxylases and propose that the interaction of a signalling sensor with a large group of proteins might be a general mechanism for the regulation of signalling pathways.",

    "synopsis": "Fast neuronal oscillations (gamma, 20-80 Hz) have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency-current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size. By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20-80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.",

    "synopsis": "The complement system is key to innate immunity and its activation is necessary for the clearance of bacteria and apoptotic cells. However, insufficient or excessive complement activation will lead to immune-related diseases. It is so far unknown how the complement activity is up- or down- regulated and what the associated pathophysiological mechanisms are. To quantitatively understand the modulatory mechanisms of the complement system, we built a computational model involving the enhancement and suppression mechanisms that regulate complement activity. Our model consists of a large system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) accompanied by a dynamic Bayesian network as a probabilistic approximation of the ODE dynamics. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, this approximation was used to perform parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis. Our combined computational and experimental study showed that the antimicrobial response is sensitive to changes in pH and calcium levels, which determines the strength of the crosstalk between CRP and L-ficolin. Our study also revealed differential regulatory effects of C4BP. While C4BP delays but does not decrease the classical complement activation, it attenuates but does not significantly delay the lectin pathway activation. We also found that the major inhibitory role of C4BP is to facilitate the decay of C3 convertase. In summary, the present work elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the complement system and demonstrates how the bio-pathway machinery maintains the balance between activation and inhibition. The insights we have gained could contribute to the development of therapies targeting the complement system.",

After establishing the periodicity of the subcritical oscillatory solution, the nature of the transition is studied. It is found to be a resonance bifurcation, with the solution branching at the critical point to another periodic solution of the same period.

Because of complex, nonlinear relations within the pathway, key dynamic properties remained to be identified to predict possible strategies for intervention. We report the development of dynamic pathway models based on quantitative data collected on signaling components of JAK/STAT pathway in two lymphoma-derived cell lines, MedB-1 and L1236, representative of PMBL and cHL, respectively. We show that the amounts of STAT5 and STAT6 are higher whereas those of SHP1 are lower in the two lymphoma cell lines than in normal B cells. Distinctively, L1236 cells harbor more JAK2 and less SHP1 molecules per cell than MedB-1 or control cells. In both lymphoma cell lines, we observe interleukin-13 (IL13)-induced activation of IL4 receptor \u03b1, JAK2, and STAT5, but not of STAT6. Genome-wide, 11 early and 16 sustained genes are upregulated by IL13 in both lymphoma cell lines. Specifically, the known STAT-inducible negative regulators CISH and SOCS3 are upregulated within 2 hours in MedB-1 but not in L1236 cells. On the basis of this detailed quantitative information, we established two mathematical models, MedB-1 and L1236 model, able to describe the respective experimental data. Most of the model parameters are identifiable and therefore the models are predictive. Sensitivity analysis of the model identifies six possible therapeutic targets able to reduce gene expression levels in L1236 cells and three in MedB-1. We experimentally confirm reduction in target gene expression in response to inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation, thereby validating one of the predicted targets.",

    "synopsis": "Living organisms perform and control complex behaviours by using webs of chemical reactions organized in precise networks. This powerful system concept, which is at the very core of biology, has recently become a new foundation for bioengineering. Remarkably, however, it is still extremely difficult to rationally create such network architectures in artificial, non-living and well-controlled settings. We introduce here a method for such a purpose, on the basis of standard DNA biochemistry. This approach is demonstrated by assembling de novo an efficient chemical oscillator: we encode the wiring of the corresponding network in the sequence of small DNA templates and obtain the predicted dynamics. Our results show that the rational cascading of standard elements opens the possibility to implement complex behaviours in vitro. Because of the simple and well-controlled environment, the corresponding chemical network is easily amenable to quantitative mathematical analysis. These synthetic systems may thus accelerate our understanding of the underlying principles of biological dynamic modules.",

To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals.

    "synopsis": "The restriction point (R-point) marks the critical event when a mammalian cell commits to proliferation and becomes independent of growth stimulation. It is fundamental for normal differentiation and tissue homeostasis, and seems to be dysregulated in virtually all cancers. Although the R-point has been linked to various activities involved in the regulation of G1-S transition of the mammalian cell cycle, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using single-cell measurements, we show here that the Rb-E2F pathway functions as a bistable switch to convert graded serum inputs into all-or-none E2F responses. Once turned ON by sufficient serum stimulation, E2F can memorize and maintain this ON state independently of continuous serum stimulation. We further show that, at critical concentrations and duration of serum stimulation, bistable E2F activation correlates directly with the ability of a cell to traverse the R-point.",

The system considered is that of two allosteric enzymes coupled in series and activated by their respective products. In addition to simple periodic oscillations, the system can exhibit a variety of new modes of dynamic behavior; coexistence between two stable periodic regimes (birhythmicity), random oscillations (chaos), and coexistence of a stable periodic regime with a stable steady state (hard excitation) or with chaos. The relationship between these patterns of temporal self-organization is analyzed as a function of the control parameters of the model. Chaos and birhythmicity appear to be rare events in comparison with simple periodic behavior. We discuss the relevance of these results with respect to the regularity of most biological rhythms.",

METHODS: Male rats received a single oral dose of 80 mg/kg L-dopa or 20 mg/kg benserazide or 80/20 mg/kg L-dopa/benserazide. Based on plasma concentrations the kinetics of L-dopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), benserazide, and its metabolite Ro 04-5127 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis and a compartmental model where total L-dopa clearance was the sum of the clearances mediated by amino-acid-decarboxylase (AADC), catechol-O-methyltransferase and other enzymes. In the model Ro 04-5127 inhibited competitively the L-dopa clearance by AADC. RESULTS: The coadministration of L-dopa/benserazide resulted in a major increase in systemic exposure to L-dopa and 3-OMD and a decrease in L-dopa clearance. The compartmental model allowed an adequate description of the observed L-dopa and 3-OMD concentrations in the absence and presence of benserazide. It had an advantage over noncompartmental analysis because it could describe the temporal change of inhibition and recovery of AADC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first investigation where the kinetics of benserazide and Ro 04-5127 have been described by a compartmental model. The L-dopa/benserazide model allowed a mechanism-based view of the L-dopa/benserazide interaction and supports the hypothesis that Ro 04-5127 is the primary active metabolite of benserazide.",

    "title": "Voltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber.",
    "synopsis": "Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.",

    "synopsis": "The ability to engineer an all-or-none cellular response to a given signaling ligand is important in applications ranging from biosensing to tissue engineering. However, synthetic gene network 'switches' have been limited in their applicability and tunability due to their reliance on specific components to function. Here, we present a strategy for reversible switch design that instead relies only on a robust, easily constructed network topology with two positive feedback loops and we apply the method to create highly ultrasensitive (n(H)>20), bistable cellular responses to a synthetic ligand/receptor complex. Independent modulation of the two feedback strengths enables rational tuning and some decoupling of steady-state (ultrasensitivity, signal amplitude, switching threshold, and bistability) and kinetic (rates of system activation and deactivation) response properties. Our integrated computational and synthetic biology approach elucidates design rules for building cellular switches with desired properties, which may be of utility in engineering signal-transduction pathways.",

    "synopsis": "Photoreceptor cells finely adjust their sensitivity and electrical response according to changes in light stimuli as a direct consequence of the feedback and regulation mechanisms in the phototransduction cascade. In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to develop a dynamic model of vertebrate rod phototransduction that accounts for the details of the underlying biochemistry. Following a bottom-up strategy, we first reproduced the results of a robust model developed by Hamer et al. (Vis. Neurosci., 2005, 22(4), 417), and then added a number of additional cascade reactions including: (a) explicit reactions to simulate the interaction between the activated effector and the regulator of G-protein signalling (RGS); (b) a reaction for the reformation of the G-protein from separate subunits; (c) a reaction for rhodopsin (R) reconstitution from the association of the opsin apoprotein with the 11-cis-retinal chromophore; (d) reactions for the slow activation of the cascade by opsin. The extended network structure successfully reproduced a number of experimental conditions that were inaccessible to prior models. With a single set of parameters the model was able to predict qualitative and quantitative features of rod photoresponses to light stimuli ranging over five orders of magnitude, in normal and altered conditions, including genetic manipulations of the cascade components. In particular, the model reproduced the salient dynamic features of the rod from Rpe65(-/-) animals, a well established model for Leber congenital amaurosis and vitamin A deficiency. The results of this study suggest that a systems-level approach can help to unravel the adaptation mechanisms in normal and in disease-associated conditions on a molecular basis.",

    "synopsis": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple, physiologically based mathematical model of pancreatic duct cell secretion using experimentally derived parameters that generates pancreatic fluid bicarbonate concentrations of >140 mM after CFTR activation. METHODS: A new mathematical model was developed simulating a duct cell within a proximal pancreatic duct and included a sodium-2-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) and sodium-potassium pump (NaK pump) on a chloride-impermeable basolateral membrane, CFTR on the luminal membrane with 0.2 to 1 bicarbonate to chloride permeability ratio. Chloride-bicarbonate antiporters (Cl/HCO3 AP) were added or subtracted from the basolateral (APb) and luminal (APl) membranes. The model was integrated over time using XPPAUT. RESULTS: This model predicts robust, NaK pump-dependent bicarbonate secretion with opening of the CFTR, generates and maintains pancreatic fluid secretion with bicarbonate concentrations >140 mM, and returns to basal levels with CFTR closure. Limiting CFTR permeability to bicarbonate, as seen in some CFTR mutations, markedly inhibited pancreatic bicarbonate and fluid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: A simple CFTR-dependent duct cell model can explain active, high-volume, high-concentration bicarbonate secretion in pancreatic juice that reproduces the experimental findings. This model may also provide insight into why CFTR mutations that predominantly affect bicarbonate permeability predispose to pancreatic dysfunction in humans.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: The individual character of pharmacokinetics is of great importance in the risk assessment of new drug leads in pharmacological research. Amongst others, it is severely influenced by the properties and inter-individual variability of the enzymes and transporters of the drug detoxification system of the liver. Predicting individual drug biotransformation capacity requires quantitative and detailed models. RESULTS: In this contribution we present the de novo deterministic modeling of atorvastatin biotransformation based on comprehensive published knowledge on involved metabolic and transport pathways as well as physicochemical properties. The model was evaluated on primary human hepatocytes and parameter identifiability analysis was performed under multiple experimental constraints. Dynamic simulations of atorvastatin biotransformation considering the inter-individual variability of the two major involved enzymes CYP3A4 and UGT1A3 based on quantitative protein expression data in a large human liver bank (n = 150) highlighted the variability in the individual biotransformation profiles and therefore also points to the individuality of pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: A dynamic model for the biotransformation of atorvastatin has been developed using quantitative metabolite measurements in primary human hepatocytes. The model comprises kinetics for transport processes and metabolic enzymes as well as population liver expression data allowing us to assess the impact of inter-individual variability of concentrations of key proteins. Application of computational tools for parameter sensitivity analysis enabled us to considerably improve the validity of the model and to create a consistent framework for precise computer-aided simulations in toxicology.",

    "title": "A mathematical model of lipid-mediated thrombin generation.",
    "synopsis": "Thrombin is an enzyme that is generated in both vascular and non-vascular systems. In blood coagulation, a fundamental process in all species, thrombin induces the formation of a fibrin clot. A dynamical model of thrombin generation in the presence of lipid surfaces is presented. This model also includes the self-regulating thrombin feedback reactions, the thrombomodulin-protein C-protein S inhibitory system, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and the inhibitor, antithrombin (AT). The dynamics of this complex system were found to be highly lipid dependent, as would be expected from experimental studies. Simulations of this model indicate that a threshold lipid level is required to generate physiologically relevant amounts of thrombin. The dependence of the onset, the peak levels, and the duration of thrombin generation on lipid was saturable. The lipid concentration affects the way in which the inhibitors modulate thrombin production. A novel feature of this model is the inclusion of the dynamical protein C pathway, initiated by thrombin feedback. This inhibitory system exerts its effects on the lipid surface, where its substrates are formed. The maximum impact of TFPI occurs at intermediate vesicle concentrations. Inhibition by AT is only indirectly affected by the lipid since AT irreversibly binds only to solution phase proteins. In a system with normal plasma concentrations of the proteins involved in thrombin formation, the combination of these three inhibitors is sufficient both to effectively stop thrombin generation prior to the exhaustion of its precursor, prothrombin, and to inhibit all thrombin formed. This model can be used to predict thrombin generation under extreme lipid conditions that are difficult to implement experimentally and to examine thrombin generation in non-vascular systems.",

The model accounts for the formation, expression, and propagation of the vitamin K-dependent procoagulant complexes and extends our previous model by including: (a) the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-mediated inactivation of tissue factor (TF).VIIa and its product complexes; (b) the antithrombin-III (AT-III)-mediated inactivation of IIa, mIIa, factor VIIa, factor IXa, and factor Xa; (c) the initial activation of factor V and factor VIII by thrombin generated by factor Xa-membrane; (d) factor VIIIa dissociation/activity loss; (e) the binding competition and kinetic activation steps that exist between TF and factors VII and VIIa; and (f) the activation of factor VII by IIa, factor Xa, and factor IXa. These additions to our earlier model generate a model consisting of 34 differential equations with 42 rate constants that together describe the 27 independent equilibrium expressions, which describe the fates of 34 species. Simulations are initiated by \"exposing\" picomolar concentrations of TF to an electronic milieu consisting of factors II, IX, X, VII, VIIa, V, and VIIII, and the anticoagulants TFPI and AT-III at concentrations found in normal plasma or associated with coagulation pathology. The reaction followed in terms of thrombin generation, proceeds through phases that can be operationally defined as initiation, propagation, and termination. The generation of thrombin displays a nonlinear dependence upon TF, AT-III, and TFPI and the combination of these latter inhibitors displays kinetic thresholds. At subthreshold TF, thrombin production/expression is suppressed by the combination of TFPI and AT-III; for concentrations above the TF threshold, the bolus of thrombin produced is quantitatively equivalent. A comparison of the model with empirical laboratory data illustrates that most experimentally observable parameters are captured, and the pathology that results in enhanced or deficient thrombin generation is accurately described.",

Differential equations describing the fate of each species in the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of the tissue factor pathway, a physical constraint associated with the stability of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been incorporated into the model based upon the empirical observations associated with the stability of this complex. The model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through a range of initiator (factor VIIa-tissue factor) concentrations ranging from 5 pM to 5 nM. The model is responsive to alterations in the concentrations of factor VIII, factor V, and their respective activated species, factor VIIIa and factor Va, and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical data. The computer model permits the assessment of the reaction over a broad range of conditions and provides a useful tool for the development and management of reaction studies.",

Here we develop a novel model of beta -cell mass, insulin, and glucose dynamics, which consists of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where glucose and insulin dynamics are fast relative to beta-cell mass dynamics. For normal parameter values, the model has two stable fixed points (representing physiological and pathological steady states), separated on a slow manifold by a saddle point. Mild hyperglycemia leads to the growth of the beta -cell mass (negative feedback) while extreme hyperglycemia leads to the reduction of the beta-cell mass (positive feedback). The model predicts that there are three pathways in prolonged hyperglycemia: (1) the physiological fixed point can be shifted to a hyperglycemic level (regulated hyperglycemia), (2) the physiological and saddle points can be eliminated (bifurcation), and (3) progressive defects in glucose and/or insulin dynamics can drive glucose levels up at a rate faster than the adaptation of the beta -cell mass which can drive glucose levels down (dynamical hyperglycemia).",

    "synopsis": "Mammalian cells can decode the concentration of extracellular transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and transduce this cue into appropriate cell fate decisions. How variable TGF-\u03b2 ligand doses quantitatively control intracellular signaling dynamics and how continuous ligand doses are translated into discontinuous cellular fate decisions remain poorly understood. Using a combined experimental and mathematical modeling approach, we discovered that cells respond differently to continuous and pulsating TGF-\u03b2 stimulation. The TGF-\u03b2 pathway elicits a transient signaling response to a single pulse of TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, whereas it is capable of integrating repeated pulses of ligand stimulation at short time interval, resulting in sustained phospho-Smad2 and transcriptional responses. Additionally, the TGF-\u03b2 pathway displays different sensitivities to ligand doses at different time scales. While ligand-induced short-term Smad2 phosphorylation is graded, long-term Smad2 phosphorylation is switch-like to a small change in TGF-\u03b2 levels. Correspondingly, the short-term Smad7 gene expression is graded, while long-term PAI-1 gene expression is switch-like, as is the long-term growth inhibitory response. Our results suggest that long-term switch-like signaling responses in the TGF-\u03b2 pathway might be critical for cell fate determination.",

    "synopsis": "Insulin and other hormones control target cells through a network of signal-mediating molecules. Such networks are extremely complex due to multiple feedback loops in combination with redundancy, shared signal mediators, and cross-talk between signal pathways. We present a novel framework that integrates experimental work and mathematical modeling to quantitatively characterize the role and relation between co-existing submechanisms in complex signaling networks. The approach is independent of knowing or uniquely estimating model parameters because it only relies on (i) rejections and (ii) core predictions (uniquely identified properties in unidentifiable models). The power of our approach is demonstrated through numerous iterations between experiments, model-based data analyses, and theoretical predictions to characterize the relative role of co-existing feedbacks governing insulin signaling. We examined phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 and endocytosis of the receptor in response to various different experimental perturbations in primary human adipocytes. The analysis revealed that receptor endocytosis is necessary for two identified feedback mechanisms involving mass and information transfer, respectively. Experimental findings indicate that interfering with the feedback may substantially increase overall signaling strength, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Because the central observations are present in other signaling networks, our results may indicate a general mechanism in hormonal control.",

    "synopsis": "Neurodegeneration is an age-related disorder which is characterised by the accumulation of aggregated protein and neuronal cell death. There are many different neurodegenerative diseases which are classified according to the specific proteins involved and the regions of the brain which are affected. Despite individual differences, there are common mechanisms at the sub-cellular level leading to loss of protein homeostasis. The two central systems in protein homeostasis are the chaperone system, which promotes correct protein folding, and the cellular proteolytic system, which degrades misfolded or damaged proteins. Since these systems and their interactions are very complex, we use mathematical modelling to aid understanding of the processes involved. The model developed in this study focuses on the role of Hsp70 (IPR00103) and Hsp90 (IPR001404) chaperones in preventing both protein aggregation and cell death. Simulations were performed under three different conditions: no stress; transient stress due to an increase in reactive oxygen species; and high stress due to sustained increases in reactive oxygen species. The model predicts that protein homeostasis can be maintained during short periods of stress. However, under long periods of stress, the chaperone system becomes overwhelmed and the probability of cell death pathways being activated increases. Simulations were also run in which cell death mediated by the JNK (P45983) and p38 (Q16539) pathways was inhibited. The model predicts that inhibiting either or both of these pathways may delay cell death but does not stop the aggregation process and that eventually cells die due to aggregated protein inhibiting proteasomal function. This problem can be overcome if the sequestration of aggregated protein into inclusion bodies is enhanced. This model predicts responses to reactive oxygen species-mediated stress that are consistent with currently available experimental data. The model can be used to assess specific interventions to reduce cell death due to impaired protein homeostasis.",

Insulin removal from the blood has been addressed in many studies. The results are highly variable with respect to insulin clearance and the relative contributions of hepatic and renal insulin degradation. RESULTS: We present a dynamic mathematical model of insulin concentration in the blood and of insulin receptor activation in hepatocytes. The model describes renal and hepatic insulin degradation, pancreatic insulin secretion and nonspecific insulin binding in the liver. Hepatic insulin receptor activation by insulin binding, receptor internalization and autophosphorylation is explicitly included in the model. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of insulin degradation and insulin clearance. Stationary model analysis shows that degradation rates, relative contributions of the different tissues to total insulin degradation and insulin clearance highly depend on the insulin concentration. CONCLUSION: This study provides a detailed dynamic model of insulin concentration in the blood and of insulin receptor activation in hepatocytes. Experimental data sets from literature are used for the model validation. We show that essential dynamic and stationary characteristics of insulin degradation are nonlinear and depend on the actual insulin concentration.",

This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a \"physiological state diagram,\" with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.",

    "synopsis": "Cellular signal transduction is governed by multiple feedback mechanisms to elicit robust cellular decisions. The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold in vivo. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.",

Our analysis of the model simulations suggests that the mitochondrial membrane potential should be relatively lower in beta cells compared with other cell types to permit precise mitochondrial regulation of the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio. This key difference may follow from a relative reduction in respiratory activity. The model demonstrates how activity of lactate dehydrogenase, uncoupling proteins and the redox shuttles can regulate beta-cell function in concert; that independent oscillations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ can lead to slow coupled metabolic oscillations; and that the relatively low production rate of reactive oxygen species in beta-cells under physiological conditions is a consequence of the relatively decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.This comprehensive model predicts a special role for mitochondrial control mechanisms in insulin secretion and ROS generation in the beta cell. The model can be used for testing and generating control hypotheses and will help to provide a more complete understanding of beta-cell glucose-sensing central to the physiology and pathology of pancreatic beta-cells.",

    "synopsis": "Circadian clocks are biological timekeepers that allow living cells to time their activity in anticipation of predictable environmental changes. Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects of altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and photoperiod, which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the Ostreococcus clock. The model suggests that a high number of light-dependent reactions are important for flexible timing in a circadian clock with only one feedback loop.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Higher plants and algae are able to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store this fixed carbon in large quantities as starch, which can be hydrolyzed into sugars serving as feedstock for fermentation to biofuels and precursors. Rational engineering of carbon flow in plant cells requires a greater understanding of how starch breakdown fluxes respond to variations in enzyme concentrations, kinetic parameters, and metabolite concentrations. We have therefore developed and simulated a detailed kinetic ordinary differential equation model of the degradation pathways for starch synthesized in plants and green algae, which to our knowledge is the most complete such model reported to date. RESULTS: Simulation with 9 internal metabolites and 8 external metabolites, the concentrations of the latter fixed at reasonable biochemical values, leads to a single reference solution showing \u03b2-amylase activity to be the rate-limiting step in carbon flow from starch degradation. Additionally, the response coefficients for stromal glucose to the glucose transporter k(cat) and KM are substantial, whereas those for cytosolic glucose are not, consistent with a kinetic bottleneck due to transport. Response coefficient norms show stromal maltopentaose and cytosolic glucosylated arabinogalactan to be the most and least globally sensitive metabolites, respectively, and \u03b2-amylase k(cat) and KM for starch to be the kinetic parameters with the largest aggregate effect on metabolite concentrations as a whole. The latter kinetic parameters, together with those for glucose transport, have the greatest effect on stromal glucose, which is a precursor for biofuel synthetic pathways. Exploration of the steady-state solution space with respect to concentrations of 6 external metabolites and 8 dynamic metabolite concentrations show that stromal metabolism is strongly coupled to starch levels, and that transport between compartments serves to lower coupling between metabolic subsystems in different compartments. CONCLUSIONS: We find that in the reference steady state, starch cleavage is the most significant determinant of carbon flux, with turnover of oligosaccharides playing a secondary role. Independence of stationary point with respect to initial dynamic variable values confirms a unique stationary point in the phase space of dynamically varying concentrations of the model network. Stromal maltooligosaccharide metabolism was highly coupled to the available starch concentration. From the most highly converged trajectories, distances between unique fixed points of phase spaces show that cytosolic maltose levels depend on the total concentrations of arabinogalactan and glucose present in the cytosol. In addition, cellular compartmentalization serves to dampen much, but not all, of the effects of one subnetwork on another, such that kinetic modeling of single compartments would likely capture most dynamics that are fast on the timescale of the transport reactions.",

    "synopsis": "Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease that profoundly affects energy homeostasis. The disease involves failure at several levels and subsystems and is characterized by insulin resistance in target cells and tissues (i.e. by impaired intracellular insulin signaling). We have previously used an iterative experimental-theoretical approach to unravel the early insulin signaling events in primary human adipocytes. That study, like most insulin signaling studies, is based on in vitro experimental examination of cells, and the in vivo relevance of such studies for human beings has not been systematically examined. Herein, we develop a hierarchical model of the adipose tissue, which links intracellular insulin control of glucose transport in human primary adipocytes with whole-body glucose homeostasis. An iterative approach between experiments and minimal modeling allowed us to conclude that it is not possible to scale up the experimentally determined glucose uptake by the isolated adipocytes to match the glucose uptake profile of the adipose tissue in vivo. However, a model that additionally includes insulin effects on blood flow in the adipose tissue and GLUT4 translocation due to cell handling can explain all data, but neither of these additions is sufficient independently. We also extend the minimal model to include hierarchical dynamic links to more detailed models (both to our own models and to those by others), which act as submodules that can be turned on or off. The resulting multilevel hierarchical model can merge detailed results on different subsystems into a coherent understanding of whole-body glucose homeostasis. This hierarchical modeling can potentially create bridges between other experimental model systems and the in vivo human situation and offers a framework for systematic evaluation of the physiological relevance of in vitro obtained molecular/cellular experimental data.",

The model includes the activation of factor X by a purified enzyme from Russel's Viper Venom (RVV), factor V and prothrombin, and also comprises the inactivation of the products formed. In this study we assume that in principle the mechanism of the process is known. However, the exact structure of the mechanism is unknown, and the process still can be described by different mathematical models. These models are put to test by measuring their capacity to explain the course of thrombin generation as observed in plasma after recalcification in presence of RVV. The mechanism studied is mathematically modelled as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Each candidate model contains some freedom, which is expressed in the model equations by the presence of unknown parameters. For example, reaction constants or initial concentrations are unknown. The goal of parameter estimation is to determine these unknown parameters in such a way that the theoretical (i.e., computed) results fit the experimental data within measurement accuracy and to judge which modifications of the chemical reaction scheme allow the best fit. We present results on model discrimination and estimation of reaction constants, which are hard to obtain in another way.",

    "synopsis": "The presence of activation peptides (AP) of the vitamin K-dependent proteins in the phlebotomy blood of human subjects suggests that active serine proteases may circulate in blood as well. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the influence of trace amounts of key coagulation proteases on tissue factor-independent thrombin generation using three models of coagulation. With procoagulants and select coagulation inhibitors at mean physiological concentrations, concentrations of factor IXa, factor Xa, and thrombin were set either equal to those of their AP or to values that would result based upon the rates of AP/enzyme generation and steady state enzyme inhibition. In the latter case, numerical simulation predicts that sufficient thrombin to produce a solid clot would be generated in approximately 2 min. Empirical data from the synthetic plasma suggest clotting times of 3-5 min, which are similar to that observed in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood (4.3 min) initiated with the same concentrations of factors IXa and Xa and thrombin. Numerical simulations performed with the concentrations of two of the enzymes held constant and one varied suggest that the presence of any pair of enzymes is sufficient to yield rapid clot formation. Modeling of states (numerical simulation and whole blood) where only one circulating protease is present at steady state concentration shows significant thrombin generation only for factor IXa. The addition of factor Xa and thrombin has little effect (if any) on thrombin generation induced by factor IXa alone. These data indicate that 1) concentrations of active coagulation enzymes circulating in vivo are significantly lower than can be predicted from the concentrations of their AP, and 2) expected trace amounts of factor IXa can trigger thrombin generation in the absence of tissue factor.",

    "synopsis": "The inactivation of factor Va is a complex process which includes bond cleavage (at three sites) and dissociation of the A2N.A2C peptides, with intermediate activity in each species. Quantitation of the functional consequences of each step in the reaction has allowed for understanding of the presentation of disease in individuals possessing the factor V polymorphism factor VLEIDEN. APC cleavage of membrane-bound bovine factor Va (Arg306, Arg505, Arg662) leads to the dissociation of fragments of the A2 domain, residues 307-713 (A2N.A2C + A2C-peptide), leaving behind the membrane-bound A1.LC species. Evaluation of the dissociation process by light scattering yields invariant mass loss estimates as a function of APC concentration. The rate constant for A2 fragment dissociation varies with [APC], reaching a maximal value of k = 0.028 s-1, the unimolecular rate constant for A2 domain fragment dissociation. The APC binding site resides in the factor Va light chain (LC) (Kd = 7 nM), suggesting that the membrane-bound LC.A1 product would act to sequester APC. This inhibitory interaction (LC.A1.APC) is demonstrated to exist with either purified factor Va LC or the products of factor Va inactivation. Utilizing these experimental data and the reported rates of bond cleavage, binding constants, and product activity values for factor Va partial inactivation products, a model is developed which describes factor Va inactivation and accounts for the defect in factor VLEIDEN. The model accurately predicts the rates of inactivation of factor Va and factor VaLEIDEN, and the effect of product inhibition. Modeled reaction progress diagrams and activity profiles (from either factor Va or factor VaLEIDEN) are coincident with experimentally derived data, providing a mechanistic and kinetic explanation for all steps in the inactivation of normal factor Va and the pathology associated with factor VLEIDEN.",

    "synopsis": "This paper focus on the quest for mechanisms that are able to create tolerance and an activation threshold in the extrinsic coagulation cascade. We propose that the interplay of coagulation inhibitor and blood flow creates threshold behavior. First we test this hypothesis in a minimal, four dimensional model. This model can be analysed by means of time scale analysis. We find indeed that only the interplay of blood flow and inhibition together are able to produce threshold behavior. The mechanism relays on a combination of raw substance supply and wash-out effect by the blood flow and a stabilization of the resting state by the inhibition. We use the insight into this minimal model to interpret the simulation results of a large model. Here, we find that the initiating steps (TF that produces together with fVII(a) factor Xa) does not exhibit threshold behavior, but the overall system does. Hence, the threshold behavior appears via the feedback loop (in that fIIa produces indirectly fXa that in turn produces fIIa again) inhibited by ATIII and blood flow.",

Hereby, we study the dynamics of the mitotic exit (ME) control system in budding yeast by further developing the Queralt's model. A comprehensive systems view of the network regulating ME is provided based on classical experiments in the literature. In this picture, Cdc20-APC is a critical node controlling both cyclin (Clb2 and Clb5) and phosphatase (Cdc14) branches of the regulatory network. On the basis of experimental situations ranging from single to quintuple mutants, the kinetic parameters of the network are estimated. Numerical analysis of the model quantifies the dependence of ME control on the proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions of separase. We show that the requirement of the non-proteolytic function of separase for ME depends on cyclin-dependent kinase activity. The model is also used for the systematic analysis of the recently discovered Cdc14 endocycles. The significance of Cdc14 endocycles in eukaryotic cell cycle control is discussed as well.",

    "synopsis": "Secretion of insulin by electrically coupled populations of pancreatic beta -cells is governed by bursting electrical activity. Isolated beta -cells, however, exhibit atypical bursting or continuous spike activity. We study bursting as an emergent property of the population, focussing on interactions among the subclass of spiking cells. These are modelled by equipping the fast subsystem with a saddle-node-loop bifurcation, which makes it monostable. Such cells can only spike tonically or remain silent when isolated, but can be induced to burst with weak diffusive coupling. With stronger coupling, the cells revert to tonic spiking. We demonstrate that the addition of noise dramatically increases, via a phenomenon like stochastic resonance, the coupling range over which bursting is seen.",

    "synopsis": "A mathematical model of the insulin-glucose feedback regulation in man is used to examine the effects of an oscillatory supply of insulin compared to a constant supply at the same average rate. We show that interactions between the oscillatory insulin supply and the receptor dynamics can be of minute significance only. It is possible, however, to interpret seemingly conflicting results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply. If the insulin level is high enough for the hepatic release of glucose to nearly vanish, the opposite effect is observed. For insulin concentrations close to the point of inflection of the insulin-glucose dose-response curve an oscillatory and a constant insulin infusion produce similar effects.",

    "synopsis": "Pancreatic islets of Langerhans produce bursts of electrical activity when exposed to stimulatory glucose levels. These bursts often have a regular repeating pattern, with a period of 10-60 s. In some cases, however, the bursts are episodic, clustered into bursts of bursts, which we call compound bursting. Consistent with this are recordings of free Ca2+ concentration, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intraislet glucose levels that exhibit very slow oscillations, with faster oscillations superimposed. We describe a new mathematical model of the pancreatic beta-cell that can account for these multimodal patterns. The model includes the feedback of cytosolic Ca2+ onto ion channels that can account for bursting, and a metabolic subsystem that is capable of producing slow oscillations driven by oscillations in glycolysis. This slow rhythm is responsible for the slow mode of compound bursting in the model. We also show that it is possible for glycolytic oscillations alone to drive a very slow form of bursting, which we call \"glycolytic bursting.\" Finally, the model predicts that there is bistability between stationary and oscillatory glycolysis for a range of parameter values. We provide experimental support for this model prediction. Overall, the model can account for a diversity of islet behaviors described in the literature over the past 20 years.",

Additional phenomena, such as the biphasic responses of beta-cells to changes in glucose concentration and the depolarizing effects of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump poison thapsigargin, are also accounted for by our model. The ability of this single hypothesis, that CRAC is present in beta-cells, to explain so many phenomena motivates a more complete characterization of this current.",

    "synopsis": "The electrical response of pancreatic beta-cells to step increases in glucose concentration is biphasic, consisting of a prolonged depolarization with action potentials (Phase 1) followed by membrane potential oscillations known as bursts. We have proposed that the Phase 1 response results from the combined depolarizing influences of potassium channel closure and an inward, nonselective cation current (ICRAN) that activates as intracellular calcium stores empty during exposure to basal glucose (Bertram et al., 1995). The stores refill during Phase 1, deactivating ICRAN and allowing steady-state bursting to commence. We support this hypothesis with additional simulations and experimental results indicating that Phase 1 duration is sensitive to the filling state of intracellular calcium stores. First, the duration of the Phase 1 transient increases with duration of prior exposure to basal (2.8 mM) glucose, reflecting the increased time required to fill calcium stores that have been emptying for longer periods. Second, Phase 1 duration is reduced when islets are exposed to elevated K+ to refill calcium stores in the presence of basal glucose. Third, when extracellular calcium is removed during the basal glucose exposure to reduce calcium influx into the stores, Phase 1 duration increases. Finally, no Phase 1 is observed following hyperpolarization of the beta-cell membrane with diazoxide in the continued presence of 11 mm glucose, a condition in which intracellular calcium stores remain full. Application of carbachol to empty calcium stores during basal glucose exposure did not increase Phase 1 duration as the model predicts. Despite this discrepancy, the good agreement between most of the experimental results and the model predictions provides evidence that a calcium release-activated current mediates the Phase 1 electrical response of the pancreatic beta-cell.",

    "synopsis": "Insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is oscillatory, with a typical period of 2-7 min, reflecting oscillations in membrane potential and the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Our central hypothesis is that the slow 2-7 min oscillations are due to glycolytic oscillations, whereas faster oscillations that are superimposed are due to Ca(2+) feedback onto metabolism or ion channels. We extend a previous mathematical model based on this hypothesis to include a more detailed description of mitochondrial metabolism. We demonstrate that this model can account for typical oscillatory patterns of membrane potential and Ca(2+) concentration in islets. It also accounts for temporal data on oxygen consumption in islets. A recent challenge to the notion that glycolytic oscillations drive slow Ca(2+) oscillations in islets are data showing that oscillations in Ca(2+), mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and NAD(P)H levels are all terminated by membrane hyperpolarization. We demonstrate that these data are in fact compatible with a model in which glycolytic oscillations are the key player in rhythmic islet activity. Finally, we use the model to address the recent finding that the activity of islets from some mice is uniformly fast, whereas that from islets of other mice is slow. We propose a mechanism for this dichotomy.",

    "synopsis": "Pancreatic beta-cells exhibit bursting oscillations with a wide range of periods. Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s). We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.",

Model parameters were set to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model-independent estimates of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in normal. The same strategy is also applied on a smaller database for extending the model to type 2 diabetes.",

    "synopsis": "A wave of apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs normally in pancreatic beta-cells of newborn mice. We previously showed that macrophages from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice become activated more slowly and engulf apoptotic cells at a lower rate than macrophages from control (Balb/c) mice. It has been hypothesized that this low clearance could result in secondary necrosis, escalating inflammation and self-antigen presentation that later triggers autoimmune, Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We here investigate whether this hypothesis could offer a reasonable and parsimonious explanation for onset of T1D in NOD mice. We quantify variants of the Copenhagen model (Freiesleben De Blasio et al. 1999 Diabetes 48, 1677), based on parameters from NOD and Balb/c experimental data. We show that the original Copenhagen model fails to explain observed phenomena within a reasonable range of parameter values, predicting an unrealistic all-or-none disease occurrence for both strains. However, if we take into account that, in general, activated macrophages produce harmful cytokines only when engulfing necrotic (but not apoptotic) cells, then the revised model becomes qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable. Further, we show that known differences between NOD and Balb/c mouse macrophage kinetics are large enough to account for the fact that an apoptotic wave can trigger escalating inflammatory response in NOD, but not Balb/c mice. In Balb/c mice, macrophages clear the apoptotic wave so efficiently, that chronic inflammation is prevented.",

    "synopsis": "Oscillations in human insulin secretion have been observed in two distinct period ranges, 10-15 min (i.e. rapid) and 100-150 min (i.e., ultradian). The cause of the ultradian oscillations remains to be elucidated. To determine whether the oscillations could result from the feedback loops between insulin and glucose, a parsimonious mathematical model including the major mechanisms involved in glucose regulation was developed. This model comprises two major negative feedback loops describing the effects of insulin on glucose utilization and glucose production, respectively, and both loops include the stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin secretion. Model formulations and parameters are representative of results from published clinical investigations. The occurrence of sustained insulin and glucose oscillations was found to be dependent on two essential features: 1) a time delay of 30-45 min for the effect of insulin on glucose production and 2) a sluggish effect of insulin on glucose utilization, because insulin acts from a compartment remote from plasma. When these characteristics were incorporated in the model, numerical simulations mimicked all experimental findings so far observed for these ultradian oscillations, including 1) self-sustained oscillations during constant glucose infusion at various rates; 2) damped oscillations after meal or oral glucose ingestion; 3) increased amplitude of oscillation after increased stimulation of insulin secretion, without change in frequency; and 4) slight advance of the glucose oscillation compared with the insulin oscillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Thermodynamically consistent model calibration in chemical kinetics.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: The dynamics of biochemical reaction systems are constrained by the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, which impose well-defined relationships among the reaction rate constants characterizing these systems. Constructing biochemical reaction systems from experimental observations often leads to parameter values that do not satisfy the necessary thermodynamic constraints. This can result in models that are not physically realizable and may lead to inaccurate, or even erroneous, descriptions of cellular function. RESULTS: We introduce a thermodynamically consistent model calibration (TCMC) method that can be effectively used to provide thermodynamically feasible values for the parameters of an open biochemical reaction system. The proposed method formulates the model calibration problem as a constrained optimization problem that takes thermodynamic constraints (and, if desired, additional non-thermodynamic constraints) into account. By calculating thermodynamically feasible values for the kinetic parameters of a well-known model of the EGF/ERK signaling cascade, we demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative significance of imposing thermodynamic constraints on these parameters and the effectiveness of our method for accomplishing this important task. MATLAB software, using the Systems Biology Toolbox 2.1, can be accessed from http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~goutsias/CSS lab/software.html. An SBML file containing the thermodynamically feasible EGF/ERK signaling cascade model can be found in the BioModels database. CONCLUSIONS: TCMC is a simple and flexible method for obtaining physically plausible values for the kinetic parameters of open biochemical reaction systems. It can be effectively used to recalculate a thermodynamically consistent set of parameter values for existing thermodynamically infeasible biochemical reaction models of cellular function as well as to estimate thermodynamically feasible values for the parameters of new models. Furthermore, TCMC can provide dimensionality reduction, better estimation performance, and lower computational complexity, and can help to alleviate the problem of data overfitting.",

    "synopsis": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a known risk factor for heart disease, and at the cellular level is caused by a complex interaction of signal transduction pathways. The IP3-calcineurin pathway plays an important role in stimulating the transcription factor NFAT which binds to DNA cooperatively with other hypertrophic transcription factors. Using available kinetic data, we construct a mathematical model of the IP3 signal production system after stimulation by a hypertrophic alpha-adrenergic agonist (endothelin-1) in the mouse atrial cardiac myocyte. We use a global sensitivity analysis to identify key controlling parameters with respect to the resultant IP3 transient, including the phosphorylation of cell-membrane receptors, the ligand strength and binding kinetics to precoupled (with G(alpha)GDP) receptor, and the kinetics associated with precoupling the receptors. We show that the kinetics associated with the receptor system contribute to the behavior of the system to a great extent, with precoupled receptors driving the response to extracellular ligand. Finally, by reparameterizing for a second hypertrophic alpha-adrenergic agonist, angiotensin-II, we show that differences in key receptor kinetic and membrane density parameters are sufficient to explain different observed IP3 transients in essentially the same pathway.",

The model is built from modular units representing the molecular components involved, which are each assigned a known value of intracellular concentration and enzymatic rate constant wherever possible. The components are linked into a network of coupled biochemical reactions based on a compilation of widely accepted mechanisms but incorporating several novel features. The computer motor shows the same pattern of runs, tumbles and pauses seen in actual bacteria and responds in the same way as living bacteria to sudden changes in concentration of aspartate or Ni2+. The simulated network accurately reproduces the phenotype of more than 30 mutants in which components of the chemotactic pathway are deleted and/or expressed in excess amounts and shows a rapidity of response to a step change in aspartate concentration similar to living bacteria. Discrepancies between the simulation and real bacteria in the phenotype of certain mutants and in the gain of the chemotactic response to aspartate suggest the existence of additional as yet unidentified interactions in the in vivo signal processing pathway.",

While these diagrams are useful for analyzing biological systems on a large scale, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the observed network connections is critical for the further development of systems and synthetic biology. Here, we use queueing theory to investigate how 'waiting lines' can lead to correlations between protein 'customers' that are coupled solely through a downstream set of enzymatic 'servers'. Using the E. coli ClpXP degradation machine as a model processing system, we observe significant cross-talk between two networks that are indirectly coupled through a common set of processors. We further illustrate the implications of enzymatic queueing using a synthetic biology application, in which two independent synthetic networks demonstrate synchronized behavior when common ClpXP machinery is overburdened. Our results demonstrate that such post-translational processes can lead to dynamic connections in cellular networks and may provide a mechanistic understanding of existing but currently inexplicable links.",

However, little is known about expression limits of genes required to halt cellular systems. In this study, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we developed a genetic 'tug-of-war' (gTOW) method to assess the overexpression limit of certain genes. Using gTOW, we determined copy number limits for 31 cell-cycle regulators; the limits varied from 1 to >100. Comparison with orthologs of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested the presence of a conserved fragile core in the eukaryotic cell cycle. Robustness profiles of networks regulating cytokinesis in both yeasts (septation-initiation network (SIN) and mitotic exit network (MEN)) were quite different, probably reflecting differences in their physiologic functions. Fragility in the regulation of GTPase spg1 was due to dosage imbalance against GTPase-activating protein (GAP) byr4. Using the gTOW data, we modified a mathematical model and successfully reproduced the robustness of the S. pombe cell cycle with the model.",

    "title": "Heterogeneity reduces sensitivity of cell death for TNF-stimuli.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and the removal of potentially damaged cells in multicellular organisms. By binding its cognate membrane receptor, TNF receptor type 1 (TNF-R1), the proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) activates pro-apoptotic signaling via caspase activation, but at the same time also stimulates nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated survival pathways. Differential dose-response relationships of these two major TNF signaling pathways have been described experimentally and using mathematical modeling. However, the quantitative analysis of the complex interplay between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways is an open question as it is challenging for several reasons: the overall signaling network is complex, various time scales are present, and cells respond quantitatively and qualitatively in a heterogeneous manner. RESULTS: This study analyzes the complex interplay of the crosstalk of TNF-R1 induced pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways based on an experimentally validated mathematical model. The mathematical model describes the temporal responses on both the single cell level as well as the level of a heterogeneous cell population, as observed in the respective quantitative experiments using TNF-R1 stimuli of different strengths and durations. Global sensitivity of the heterogeneous population was quantified by measuring the average gradient of time of death versus each population parameter. This global sensitivity analysis uncovers the concentrations of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3, and their respective inhibitors BAR and XIAP, as key elements for deciding the cell's fate. A simulated knockout of the NF-\u03baB-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling reveals the importance of this pathway for delaying the time of death, reducing the death rate in the case of pulse stimulation and significantly increasing cell-to-cell variability. CONCLUSIONS: Cell ensemble modeling of a heterogeneous cell population including a global sensitivity analysis presented here allowed us to illuminate the role of the different elements and parameters on apoptotic signaling. The receptors serve to transmit the external stimulus; procaspases and their inhibitors control the switching from life to death, while NF-\u03baB enhances the heterogeneity of the cell population. The global sensitivity analysis of the cell population model further revealed an unexpected impact of heterogeneity, i.e. the reduction of parametric sensitivity.",

    "title": "Analyzing the functional properties of the creatine kinase system with multiscale 'sloppy' modeling.",
    "synopsis": "In this study the function of the two isoforms of creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) in myocardium is investigated. The 'phosphocreatine shuttle' hypothesis states that mitochondrial and cytosolic CK plays a pivotal role in the transport of high-energy phosphate (HEP) groups from mitochondria to myofibrils in contracting muscle. Temporal buffering of changes in ATP and ADP is another potential role of CK. With a mathematical model, we analyzed energy transport and damping of high peaks of ATP hydrolysis during the cardiac cycle. The analysis was based on multiscale data measured at the level of isolated enzymes, isolated mitochondria and on dynamic response times of oxidative phosphorylation measured at the whole heart level. Using 'sloppy modeling' ensemble simulations, we derived confidence intervals for predictions of the contributions by phosphocreatine (PCr) and ATP to the transfer of HEP from mitochondria to sites of ATP hydrolysis. Our calculations indicate that only 15\u00b18% (mean\u00b1SD) of transcytosolic energy transport is carried by PCr, contradicting the PCr shuttle hypothesis. We also predicted temporal buffering capabilities of the CK isoforms protecting against high peaks of ATP hydrolysis (3750 \u00b5M*s(-1)) in myofibrils. CK inhibition by 98% in silico leads to an increase in amplitude of mitochondrial ATP synthesis pulsation from 215\u00b123 to 566\u00b131 \u00b5M*s(-1), while amplitudes of oscillations in cytosolic ADP concentration double from 77\u00b111 to 146\u00b11 \u00b5M. Our findings indicate that CK acts as a large bandwidth high-capacity temporal energy buffer maintaining cellular ATP homeostasis and reducing oscillations in mitochondrial metabolism. However, the contribution of CK to the transport of high-energy phosphate groups appears limited. Mitochondrial CK activity lowers cytosolic inorganic phosphate levels while cytosolic CK has the opposite effect.",

    "synopsis": "After anaphase, the high mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity is downregulated to promote exit from mitosis. To this end, in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Net1. During anaphase, Cdk- and Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 is thought to release active Cdc14. How Net1 is phosphorylated specifically in anaphase, when mitotic kinase activity starts to decline, has remained unexplained. Here, we show that PP2A(Cdc55) phosphatase keeps Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase. The sister chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset, interacts with and downregulates PP2A(Cdc55), thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A(Cdc55) downregulation also promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the \"mitotic exit network\" that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines. These findings allow us to present a new quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast.",

Disruption or disturbance leads to variant clinical disorders. To develop strategies for disease intervention, delineation of the pathway in further detail is required. Current theoretical models of this pathway describe production and degradation of signal mediating proteins and signal transduction from the cell surface into the nucleus, whereas feedback loops have not exhaustively been included. In this study we present a mathematical model to determine the relevance of feedback regulators (Arkadia, Smad7, Smurf1, Smurf2, SnoN and Ski) on TGF-\u03b2 target gene expression and the potential to initiate stable oscillations within a realistic parameter space. We employed massive sampling of the parameters space to pinpoint crucial players for potential oscillations as well as transcriptional product levels. We identified Smad7 and Smurf2 with the highest impact on the dynamics. Based on these findings, we conducted preliminary time course experiments.",

    "synopsis": "Endogenous circadian rhythms allow living organisms to anticipate daily variations in their natural environment. Temperature regulation and entrainment mechanisms of circadian clocks are still poorly understood. To better understand the molecular basis of these processes, we built a mathematical model based on experimental data examining temperature regulation of the circadian RNA-binding protein CHLAMY1 from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, simulating the effect of temperature on the rates by applying the Arrhenius equation. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model is temperature-compensated and can be entrained to temperature cycles of various length and amplitude. The range of periods that allow entrainment of the model depends on the shape of the temperature cycles and is larger for sinusoidal compared to rectangular temperature curves. We show that the response to temperature of protein (de)phosphorylation rates play a key role in facilitating temperature entrainment of the oscillator in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We systematically investigated the response of our model to single temperature pulses to explain experimentally observed phase response curves.",

    "synopsis": "Circadian clocks synchronise biological processes with the day/night cycle, using molecular mechanisms that include interlocked, transcriptional feedback loops. Recent experiments identified the evening complex (EC) as a repressor that can be essential for gene expression rhythms in plants. Integrating the EC components in this role significantly alters our mechanistic, mathematical model of the clock gene circuit. Negative autoregulation of the EC genes constitutes the clock's evening loop, replacing the hypothetical component Y. The EC explains our earlier conjecture that the morning gene Pseudo-Response Regulator 9 was repressed by an evening gene, previously identified with Timing Of CAB Expression1 (TOC1). Our computational analysis suggests that TOC1 is a repressor of the morning genes Late Elongated Hypocotyl and Circadian Clock Associated1 rather than an activator as first conceived. This removes the necessity for the unknown component X (or TOC1mod) from previous clock models. As well as matching timeseries and phase-response data, the model provides a new conceptual framework for the plant clock that includes a three-component repressilator circuit in its complex structure.",

    "synopsis": "The generation of off-flavors in soybean homogenates such as n-hexanal via the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway can be a problem in the processed food industry. Previous studies have examined the effect of using soybean varieties missing one or more of the 3 LOX isozymes on n-hexanal generation. A dynamic mathematical model of the soybean LOX pathway using ordinary differential equations was constructed using parameters estimated from existing data with the aim of predicting how n-hexanal generation could be reduced. Time-course simulations of LOX-null beans were run and compared with experimental results. Model L(2), L(3), and L(12) beans were within the range relative to the wild type found experimentally, with L(13) and L(23) beans close to the experimental range. Model L(1) beans produced much more n-hexanal relative to the wild type than those in experiments. Sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing the estimated K(m) parameter for LOX isozyme 3 (L-3) would improve the fit between model predictions and experimental results found in the literature. The model also predicts that increasing L-3 or reducing L-2 levels within beans may reduce n-hexanal generation.This work describes the use of mathematics to attempt to quantify the enzyme-catalyzed conversions of compounds in soybean homogenates into undesirable flavors, primarily from the compound n-hexanal. The effect of different soybean genotypes and enzyme kinetic constants was also studied, leading to recommendations on which combinations might minimize off-flavor levels and what further work might be carried out to substantiate these conclusions.",

    "title": "The influence of cytokinin-auxin cross-regulation on cell-fate determination in Arabidopsis thaliana root development.",
    "synopsis": "Root growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana are sustained by a specialised zone termed the meristem, which contains a population of dividing and differentiating cells that are functionally analogous to a stem cell niche in animals. The hormones auxin and cytokinin control meristem size antagonistically. Local accumulation of auxin promotes cell division and the initiation of a lateral root primordium. By contrast, high cytokinin concentrations disrupt the regular pattern of divisions that characterises lateral root development, and promote differentiation. The way in which the hormones interact is controlled by a genetic regulatory network. In this paper, we propose a deterministic mathematical model to describe this network and present model simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed effects of cytokinin on the expression of auxin regulated genes. We show how auxin response genes and auxin efflux transporters may be affected by the presence of cytokinin. We also analyse and compare the responses of the hormones auxin and cytokinin to changes in their supply with the responses obtained by genetic mutations of SHY2, which encodes a protein that plays a key role in balancing cytokinin and auxin regulation of meristem size. We show that although shy2 mutations can qualitatively reproduce the effect of varying auxin and cytokinin supply on their response genes, some elements of the network respond differently to changes in hormonal supply and to genetic mutations, implying a different, general response of the network. We conclude that an analysis based on the ratio between these two hormones may be misleading and that a mathematical model can serve as a useful tool for stimulate further experimental work by predicting the response of the network to changes in hormone levels and to other genetic mutations.",

To understand why this motif is so prevalent, we examined its properties in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory network in yeast (Oaf1p/Pip2p). We demonstrate that the asymmetry in positive feedback confers a competitive advantage and allows the system to robustly increase its responsiveness while precisely tuning the response to a consistent level in the presence of varying stimuli. This study reveals evolutionary advantages for the ASSURE motif, and mechanisms for control, that are relevant to pharmacologic intervention and synthetic biology applications.",

    "title": "Mathematical modeling elucidates the role of transcriptional feedback in gibberellin signaling.",
    "synopsis": "The hormone gibberellin (GA) is a key regulator of plant growth. Many of the components of the gibberellin signal transduction [e.g., GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1) and DELLA], biosynthesis [e.g., GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox) and GA3ox], and deactivation pathways have been identified. Gibberellin binds its receptor, GID1, to form a complex that mediates the degradation of DELLA proteins. In this way, gibberellin relieves DELLA-dependent growth repression. However, gibberellin regulates expression of GID1, GA20ox, and GA3ox, and there is also evidence that it regulates DELLA expression. In this paper, we use integrated mathematical modeling and experiments to understand how these feedback loops interact to control gibberellin signaling. Model simulations are in good agreement with in vitro data on the signal transduction and biosynthesis pathways and in vivo data on the expression levels of gibberellin-responsive genes. We find that GA-GID1 interactions are characterized by two timescales (because of a lid on GID1 that can open and close slowly relative to GA-GID1 binding and dissociation). Furthermore, the model accurately predicts the response to exogenous gibberellin after a number of chemical and genetic perturbations. Finally, we investigate the role of the various feedback loops in gibberellin signaling. We find that regulation of GA20ox transcription plays a significant role in both modulating the level of endogenous gibberellin and generating overshoots after the removal of exogenous gibberellin. Moreover, although the contribution of other individual feedback loops seems relatively small, GID1 and DELLA transcriptional regulation acts synergistically with GA20ox feedback.",

    "synopsis": "Insulin signaling through insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) is important for insulin control of target cells. We have previously demonstrated a rapid and simultaneous overshoot behavior in the phosphorylation dynamics of IR and IRS1 in human adipocytes. Herein, we demonstrate that in murine adipocytes a similar overshoot behavior is not simultaneous for IR and IRS1. The peak of IRS1 phosphorylation, which is a direct consequence of the phosphorylation and the activation of IR, occurs earlier than the peak of IR phosphorylation. We used a conclusive modeling framework to unravel the mechanisms behind this counter-intuitive order of phosphorylation. Through a number of rejections, we demonstrate that two fundamentally different mechanisms may create the reversed order of peaks: (i) two pools of phosphorylated IR, where a large pool of internalized IR peaks late, but phosphorylation of IRS1 is governed by a small plasma membrane-localized pool of IR with an early peak, or (ii) inhibition of the IR-catalyzed phosphorylation of IRS1 by negative feedback. Although (i) may explain the reversed order, this two-pool hypothesis alone requires extensive internalization of IR, which is not supported by experimental data. However, with the additional assumption of limiting concentrations of IRS1, (i) can explain all data. Also, (ii) can explain all available data. Our findings illustrate how modeling can potentiate reasoning, to help draw nontrivial conclusions regarding competing mechanisms in signaling networks. Our work also reveals new differences between human and murine insulin signaling.",

    "synopsis": "Resistance to targeted cancer therapies such as trastuzumab is a frequent clinical problem not solely because of insufficient expression of HER2 receptor but also because of the overriding activation states of cell signaling pathways. Systems biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in silico testing of factors, which may confer resistance to targeted therapies. Inthis study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic model that could be interrogated to predict resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapies and directly test predictions in vitro and in clinical samples. The new mathematical model included RTK inhibitor antibody binding, HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/mitogen-activated protein kinase cross-talk, and the regulatory properties of PTEN. The model was parameterized using quantitative phosphoprotein expression data from cancer cell lines using reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative PTEN protein expression was found to be the key determinant of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in silico, which was predictive of unseen experiments in vitro using the PTEN inhibitor bp(V). When measured in cancer cell lines, PTEN expression predicts sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy; furthermore, this quantitative measurement is more predictive of response (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5; P < 0.0001) than other pathway components taken in isolation and when tested by multivariate analysis in a cohort of 122 breast cancers treated with trastuzumab. For the first time, a systems biology approach has successfully been used to stratify patients for personalized therapy in cancer and is further compelling evidence that PTEN, appropriately measured in the clinical setting, refines clinical decision making in patients treated with anti-HER2 therapies.",

It represents a unique strategy of antibiotic tolerance and it can complicate design of effective antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of Escherichia coli to antibiotics that target the ribosome. We show that the IE can be explained by bistable inhibition of bacterial growth. A critical requirement for this bistability is sufficiently fast degradation of ribosomes, which can result from antibiotic-induced heat-shock response. Furthermore, antibiotics that elicit the IE can lead to 'band-pass' response of bacterial growth to periodic antibiotic treatment: the treatment efficacy drastically diminishes at intermediate frequencies of treatment. Our proposed mechanism for the IE may be generally applicable to other bacterial species treated with antibiotics targeting the ribosomes.",

    "synopsis": "Signal transduction and gene regulation determine a major reorganization of metabolic activities in order to support cell proliferation. Protein Kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt, participates in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, a master regulator of aerobic glycolysis and cellular biosynthesis, two activities shown by both normal and cancer proliferating cells. Not surprisingly considering its relevance for cellular metabolism, Akt/PKB is often found hyperactive in cancer cells. In the last decade, many efforts have been made to improve the understanding of the control of glucose metabolism and the identification of a therapeutic window between proliferating cancer cells and proliferating normal cells. In this context, we have modeled the link between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, glycolysis, lactic acid production, and nucleotide biosynthesis. We used a computational model to compare two metabolic states generated by two different levels of signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway: one of the two states represents the metabolism of a growing cancer cell characterized by aerobic glycolysis and cellular biosynthesis, while the other state represents the same metabolic network with a reduced glycolytic rate and a higher mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Biochemical reactions that link glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway revealed their importance for controlling the dynamics of cancer glucose metabolism.",

This approach, combined with Translational Oncology methodologies, is used to address the experimental evidence of a close relationship among EGFR and IGF1R protein expression, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene amplification, by in situ hybridization (FISH) and the corresponding ability to develop a more aggressive behavior. We develop a detailed in silico model, based on ordinary differential equations, of the pathways and study the dynamic implications of receptor alterations on the time behavior of the MAPK cascade down to ERK, which in turn governs proliferation and cell migration. In addition, an extensive sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is carried out and a simplified model is proposed which allows us to infer a similar relationship among EGFR and IGF1R activities and disease outcome.",

    "synopsis": "Kinetic models of metabolism require detailed knowledge of kinetic parameters. However, due to measurement errors or lack of data this knowledge is often uncertain. The model of glycolysis in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is a particularly well analysed example of a quantitative metabolic model, but so far it has been studied with a fixed set of parameters only. Here we evaluate the effect of parameter uncertainty. In order to define probability distributions for each parameter, information about the experimental sources and confidence intervals for all parameters were collected. We created a wiki-based website dedicated to the detailed documentation of this information: the SilicoTryp wiki (http://silicotryp.ibls.gla.ac.uk/wiki/Glycolysis). Using information collected in the wiki, we then assigned probability distributions to all parameters of the model. This allowed us to sample sets of alternative models, accurately representing our degree of uncertainty. Some properties of the model, such as the repartition of the glycolytic flux between the glycerol and pyruvate producing branches, are robust to these uncertainties. However, our analysis also allowed us to identify fragilities of the model leading to the accumulation of 3-phosphoglycerate and/or pyruvate. The analysis of the control coefficients revealed the importance of taking into account the uncertainties about the parameters, as the ranking of the reactions can be greatly affected. This work will now form the basis for a comprehensive Bayesian analysis and extension of the model considering alternative topologies.",

    "synopsis": "The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway in yeast serves as a prototype signalling system for eukaryotes. We used an unprecedented amount of data to parameterise 192 models capturing different hypotheses about molecular mechanisms underlying osmo-adaptation and selected a best approximating model. This model implied novel mechanisms regulating osmo-adaptation in yeast. The model suggested that (i) the main mechanism for osmo-adaptation is a fast and transient non-transcriptional Hog1-mediated activation of glycerol production, (ii) the transcriptional response serves to maintain an increased steady-state glycerol production with low steady-state Hog1 activity, and (iii) fast negative feedbacks of activated Hog1 on upstream signalling branches serves to stabilise adaptation response. The best approximating model also indicated that homoeostatic adaptive systems with two parallel redundant signalling branches show a more robust and faster response than single-branch systems. We corroborated this notion to a large extent by dedicated measurements of volume recovery in single cells. Our study also demonstrates that systematically testing a model ensemble against data has the potential to achieve a better and unbiased understanding of molecular mechanisms.",

    "title": "A whole-body mathematical model of cholesterol metabolism and its age-associated dysregulation.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Global demographic changes have stimulated marked interest in the process of aging. There has been, and will continue to be, an unrelenting rise in the number of the oldest old ( >85 years of age). Together with an ageing population there comes an increase in the prevalence of age related disease. Of the diseases of ageing, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has by far the highest prevalence. It is regarded that a finely tuned lipid profile may help to prevent CVD as there is a long established relationship between alterations to lipid metabolism and CVD risk. In fact elevated plasma cholesterol, particularly Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) has consistently stood out as a risk factor for having a cardiovascular event. Moreover it is widely acknowledged that LDL-C may rise with age in both sexes in a wide variety of groups. The aim of this work was to use a whole-body mathematical model to investigate why LDL-C rises with age, and to test the hypothesis that mechanistic changes to cholesterol absorption and LDL-C removal from the plasma are responsible for the rise. The whole-body mechanistic nature of the model differs from previous models of cholesterol metabolism which have either focused on intracellular cholesterol homeostasis or have concentrated on an isolated area of lipoprotein dynamics. The model integrates both current and previously published data relating to molecular biology, physiology, ageing and nutrition in an integrated fashion. RESULTS: The model was used to test the hypothesis that alterations to the rate of cholesterol absorption and changes to the rate of removal of LDL-C from the plasma are integral to understanding why LDL-C rises with age. The model demonstrates that increasing the rate of intestinal cholesterol absorption from 50% to 80% by age 65 years can result in an increase of LDL-C by as much as 34 mg/dL in a hypothetical male subject. The model also shows that decreasing the rate of hepatic clearance of LDL-C gradually to 50% by age 65 years can result in an increase of LDL-C by as much as 116 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Our model clearly demonstrates that of the two putative mechanisms that have been implicated in the dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism with age, alterations to the removal rate of plasma LDL-C has the most significant impact on cholesterol metabolism and small changes to the number of hepatic LDL receptors can result in a significant rise in LDL-C. This first whole-body systems based model of cholesterol balance could potentially be used as a tool to further improve our understanding of whole-body cholesterol metabolism and its dysregulation with age. Furthermore, given further fine tuning the model may help to investigate potential dietary and lifestyle regimes that have the potential to mitigate the effects aging has on cholesterol metabolism.",

    "synopsis": "The cell fate decision of multi-potent pancreatic progenitor cells between the exocrine and endocrine lineages is regulated by Notch signalling, mediated by cell-cell interactions. However, canonical models of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition cannot explain the scattered spatial distribution of endocrine cells and the cell-type ratio in the developing pancreas. Based on evidence from acinar-to-islet cell transdifferentiation in vitro, we propose that lateral stabilization, i.e. positive feedback between adjacent progenitor cells, acts in parallel with lateral inhibition to regulate pattern formation in the pancreas. A simple mathematical model of transcriptional regulation and cell-cell interaction reveals the existence of multi-stability of spatial patterns whose simultaneous occurrence causes scattering of endocrine cells in the presence of noise. The scattering pattern allows for control of the endocrine-to-exocrine cell-type ratio by modulation of lateral stabilization strength. These theoretical results suggest a previously unrecognized role for lateral stabilization in lineage specification, spatial patterning and cell-type ratio control in organ development.",

    "synopsis": "There is increasing evidence for a major and critical involvement of lipids in signal transduction and cellular trafficking, and this has motivated large-scale studies on lipid pathways. The Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy consortium is actively investigating lipid metabolism in mammalian cells and has made available time-course data on various lipids in response to treatment with KDO(2)-lipid A (a lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The lipids known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation. We have reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate the rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model fits the experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme activities were similar to their literature values. The quantitative model for eicosanoid metabolism that we have developed can be used to design experimental studies utilizing genetic and pharmacological perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid pathways.",

    "synopsis": "Circadian clocks provide an internal measure of external time allowing organisms to anticipate and exploit predictable daily changes in the environment. Rhythms driven by circadian clocks have a temperature compensated periodicity of approximately 24 hours that persists in constant conditions and can be reset by environmental time cues. Computational modelling has aided our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of circadian clocks, nevertheless it remains a major challenge to integrate the large number of clock components and their interactions into a single, comprehensive model that is able to account for the full breadth of clock phenotypes. Here we present a comprehensive dynamic model of the Neurospora crassa circadian clock that incorporates its key components and their transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The model accounts for a wide range of clock characteristics including: a periodicity of 21.6 hours, persistent oscillation in constant conditions, arrhythmicity in constant light, resetting by brief light pulses, and entrainment to full photoperiods. Crucial components influencing the period and amplitude of oscillations were identified by control analysis. Furthermore, simulations enabled us to propose a mechanism for temperature compensation, which is achieved by simultaneously increasing the translation of frq RNA and decreasing the nuclear import of FRQ protein.",

    "synopsis": "Modeling of biological parts is of crucial importance as it enables the in silico study of synthetic biological systems prior to the actual construction of genetic circuits, which can be time consuming and costly. Because standard biological parts are utilized to build the synthetic systems, it is important that each of these standard parts is well characterized and has a corresponding mathematical model that could simulate the characteristics of the part. These models could be used in computer aided design (CAD) tools during the design stage to facilitate the building of the model of biological systems. This paper describes the development of a mathematical model that is able to simulate both the dynamic and static performance of a biological device created using standard parts. We modeled an example quorum sensing device that produces green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter in the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL). The parameters of the model were estimated using experimental results. The simulation results show that the model was able to simulate behavior similar to experimental results. Since it is important that these models and the content in the models can be searchable and readable by machines, standard SBML (system biology markup language) format was used to store the models. All parts and reactions are fully annotated to enable easy searching, and the models follow the Minimum Information Requested In the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM) compliance as well as the Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE).",

    "synopsis": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate a variety of intracellular pathways through their ability to promote the binding of GTP to heterotrimeric G proteins. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins increases the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha-subunits and are widely regarded as negative regulators of G protein signaling. Using yeast we demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis is not only required for desensitization, but is essential for achieving a high maximal (saturated level) response. Thus RGS-mediated GTP hydrolysis acts as both a negative (low stimulation) and positive (high stimulation) regulator of signaling. To account for this we generated a new kinetic model of the G protein cycle where Galpha(GTP) enters an inactive GTP-bound state following effector activation. Furthermore, in vivo and in silico experimentation demonstrates that maximum signaling output first increases and then decreases with RGS concentration. This unimodal, non-monotone dependence on RGS concentration is novel. Analysis of the kinetic model has revealed a dynamic network motif that shows precisely how inclusion of the inactive GTP-bound state for the Galpha produces this unimodal relationship.",

    "title": "Modelling the widespread effects of TOC1 signalling on the plant circadian clock and its outputs.",
    "synopsis": "24-hour biological clocks are intimately connected to the cellular signalling network, which complicates the analysis of clock mechanisms. The transcriptional regulator TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) is a founding component of the gene circuit in the plant circadian clock. Recent results show that TOC1 suppresses transcription of multiple target genes within the clock circuit, far beyond its previously-described regulation of the morning transcription factors LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) and CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1). It is unclear how this pervasive effect of TOC1 affects the dynamics of the clock and its outputs. TOC1 also appears to function in a nested feedback loop that includes signalling by the plant hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA), which is upregulated by abiotic stresses, such as drought. ABA treatments both alter TOC1 levels and affect the clock's timing behaviour. Conversely, the clock rhythmically modulates physiological processes induced by ABA, such as the closing of stomata in the leaf epidermis. In order to understand the dynamics of the clock and its outputs under changing environmental conditions, the reciprocal interactions between the clock and other signalling pathways must be integrated.We extended the mathematical model of the plant clock gene circuit by incorporating the repression of multiple clock genes by TOC1, observed experimentally. The revised model more accurately matches the data on the clock's molecular profiles and timing behaviour, explaining the clock's responses in TOC1 over-expression and toc1 mutant plants. A simplified representation of ABA signalling allowed us to investigate the interactions of ABA and circadian pathways. Increased ABA levels lengthen the free-running period of the clock, consistent with the experimental data. Adding stomatal closure to the model, as a key ABA- and clock-regulated downstream process allowed to describe TOC1 effects on the rhythmic gating of stomatal closure.The integrated model of the circadian clock circuit and ABA-regulated environmental sensing allowed us to explain multiple experimental observations on the timing and stomatal responses to genetic and environmental perturbations. These results crystallise a new role of TOC1 as an environmental sensor, which both affects the pace of the central oscillator and modulates the kinetics of downstream processes.",

    "title": "A mathematical model of the unfolded protein stress response reveals the decision mechanism for recovery, adaptation and apoptosis.",
    "synopsis": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a major signalling cascade acting in the quality control of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The cascade is known to play an accessory role in a range of genetic and environmental disorders including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and kidney diseases. The three major receptors of the ER stress involved with the UPR, i.e. IRE1 \u03b1, PERK and ATF6, signal through a complex web of pathways to convey an appropriate response. The emerging behaviour ranges from adaptive to maladaptive depending on the severity of unfolded protein accumulation in the ER; however, the decision mechanism for the switch and its timing have so far been poorly understood.Here, we propose a mechanism by which the UPR outcome switches between survival and death. We compose a mathematical model integrating the three signalling branches, and perform a comprehensive bifurcation analysis to investigate possible responses to stimuli. The analysis reveals three distinct states of behaviour, low, high and intermediate activity, associated with stress adaptation, tolerance, and the initiation of apoptosis. The decision to adapt or destruct can, therefore, be understood as a dynamic process where the balance between the stress and the folding capacity of the ER plays a pivotal role in managing the delivery of the most appropriate response. The model demonstrates for the first time that the UPR is capable of generating oscillations in translation attenuation and the apoptotic signals, and this is supplemented with a Bayesian sensitivity analysis identifying a set of parameters controlling this behaviour.This work contributes largely to the understanding of one of the most ubiquitous signalling pathways involved in protein folding quality control in the metazoan ER. The insights gained have direct consequences on the management of many UPR-related diseases, revealing, in addition, an extended list of candidate disease modifiers. Demonstration of stress adaptation sheds light to how preconditioning might be beneficial in manifesting the UPR outcome to prevent untimely apoptosis, and paves the way to novel approaches for the treatment of many UPR-related conditions.",

    "synopsis": "Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is a potent regulator of extracellular matrix production, wound healing, differentiation, and immune response, and is implicated in the progression of fibrotic diseases and cancer. Extracellular activation of TGF-\u03b21 from its latent form provides spatiotemporal control over TGF-\u03b21 signaling, but the current understanding of TGF-\u03b21 activation does not emphasize cross talk between activators. Plasmin (PLS) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) have been studied individually as activators of TGF-\u03b21, and in this work we used a systems-level approach with mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments to study the interplay between PLS and TSP1 in TGF-\u03b21 activation. Simulations and steady-state analysis predicted a switch-like bistable transition between two levels of active TGF-\u03b21, with an inverse correlation between PLS and TSP1. In particular, the model predicted that increasing PLS breaks a TSP1-TGF-\u03b21 positive feedback loop and causes an unexpected net decrease in TGF-\u03b21 activation. To test these predictions in vitro, we treated rat hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells with PLS, which caused proteolytic cleavage of TSP1 and decreased activation of TGF-\u03b21. The TGF-\u03b21 activation levels showed a cooperative dose response, and a test of hysteresis in the cocultured cells validated that TGF-\u03b21 activation is bistable. We conclude that switch-like behavior arises from natural competition between two distinct modes of TGF-\u03b21 activation: a TSP1-mediated mode of high activation and a PLS-mediated mode of low activation. This switch suggests an explanation for the unexpected effects of the plasminogen activation system on TGF-\u03b21 in fibrotic diseases in vivo, as well as novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches for diseases with TGF-\u03b2 dysregulation.",

A previous model of mammalian polyamine metabolism showed that S-adenosyl methionine availability could play a key role in polyamine homeostasis. To get a deeper insight in this prediction, we have built a combined model by integration of the previously published polyamine model and one-carbon and glutathione metabolism model, published by different research groups. The combined model is robust and it is able to achieve physiological steady-state values, as well as to reproduce the predictions of the individual models. Furthermore, a transition between two versions of our model with new regulatory factors added properly simulates the switch in methionine adenosyl transferase isozymes occurring when the liver enters in proliferative conditions. The combined model is useful to support the previous prediction on the role of S-adenosyl methionine availability in polyamine homeostasis. Furthermore, it could be easily adapted to get deeper insights on the connections of polyamines with energy metabolism.",

    "synopsis": "Differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector or regulatory phenotypes is tightly controlled by the cytokine milieu, complex intracellular signaling networks and numerous transcriptional regulators. We combined experimental approaches and computational modeling to investigate the mechanisms controlling differentiation and plasticity of CD4+ T cells in the gut of mice. Our computational model encompasses the major intracellular pathways involved in CD4+ T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg). Our modeling efforts predicted a critical role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) in modulating plasticity between Th17 and iTreg cells. PPAR\u03b3 regulates differentiation, activation and cytokine production, thereby controlling the induction of effector and regulatory responses, and is a promising therapeutic target for dysregulated immune responses and inflammation. Our modeling efforts predict that following PPAR\u03b3 activation, Th17 cells undergo phenotype switch and become iTreg cells. This prediction was validated by results of adoptive transfer studies showing an increase of colonic iTreg and a decrease of Th17 cells in the gut mucosa of mice with colitis following pharmacological activation of PPAR\u03b3. Deletion of PPAR\u03b3 in CD4+ T cells impaired mucosal iTreg and enhanced colitogenic Th17 responses in mice with CD4+ T cell-induced colitis. Thus, for the first time we provide novel molecular evidence in vivo demonstrating that PPAR\u03b3 in addition to regulating CD4+ T cell differentiation also plays a major role controlling Th17 and iTreg plasticity in the gut mucosa.",

Among other non-intuitive outcomes, translation demonstrates a high degree of functional modularity and comprises a non-stoichiometric combination of proteins manifesting functional convergence on a shared maximal translation rate. In exponentially growing cells, polypeptide elongation (eEF1A, eEF2, and eEF3) exerts the strongest control. The two other strong control points are recruitment of mRNA and tRNA(i) to the 40S ribosomal subunit (eIF4F and eIF2) and termination (eRF1; Dbp5). In contrast, factors that are found to promote mRNA scanning efficiency on a longer than-average 5'untranslated region (eIF1, eIF1A, Ded1, eIF2B, eIF3, and eIF5) exceed the levels required for maximal control. This is expected to allow the cell to minimize scanning transition times, particularly for longer 5'UTRs. The analysis reveals these and other collective adaptations of control shared across the factors, as well as features that reflect functional modularity and system robustness. Remarkably, gene duplication is implicated in the fine control of cellular protein synthesis.",

    "synopsis": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder affecting humans, with advanced age being the most prominent risk factor for developing AD. Despite intense research efforts aimed at elucidating the precise molecular underpinnings of AD, a definitive answer is still lacking. In recent years, consensus has grown that dimerisation of the polypeptide amyloid-beta (A\u00df), particularly A\u00df\u2084\u2082, plays a crucial role in the neuropathology that characterise AD-affected post-mortem brains, including the large-scale accumulation of fibrils, also referred to as senile plaques. This has led to the realistic hope that targeting A\u00df\u2084\u2082 immunotherapeutically could drastically reduce plaque burden in the ageing brain, thus delaying AD onset or symptom progression. Stochastic modelling is a useful tool for increasing understanding of the processes underlying complex systems-affecting disorders such as AD, providing a rapid and inexpensive strategy for testing putative new therapies. In light of the tool's utility, we developed computer simulation models to examine A\u00df\u2084\u2082 turnover and its aggregation in detail and to test the effect of immunization against A\u00df dimers.Our model demonstrates for the first time that even a slight decrease in the clearance rate of A\u00df\u2084\u2082 monomers is sufficient to increase the chance of dimers forming, which could act as instigators of protofibril and fibril formation, resulting in increased plaque levels. As the process is slow and levels of A\u03b2 are normally low, stochastic effects are important. Our model predicts that reducing the rate of dimerisation leads to a significant reduction in plaque levels and delays onset of plaque formation. The model was used to test the effect of an antibody mediated immunological response. Our results showed that plaque levels were reduced compared to conditions where antibodies are not present.Our model supports the current thinking that levels of dimers are important in initiating the aggregation process. Although substantial knowledge exists regarding the process, no therapeutic intervention is on offer that reliably decreases disease burden in AD patients. Computer modelling could serve as one of a number of tools to examine both the validity of reliable biomarkers and aid the discovery of successful intervention strategies.",

    "synopsis": "Influenza viruses transcribe and replicate their negative-sense RNA genome inside the nucleus of host cells via three viral RNA species. In the course of an infection, these RNAs show distinct dynamics, suggesting that differential regulation takes place. To investigate this regulation in a systematic way, we developed a mathematical model of influenza virus infection at the level of a single mammalian cell. It accounts for key steps of the viral life cycle, from virus entry to progeny virion release, while focusing in particular on the molecular mechanisms that control viral transcription and replication. We therefore explicitly consider the nuclear export of viral genome copies (vRNPs) and a recent hypothesis proposing that replicative intermediates (cRNA) are stabilized by the viral polymerase complex and the nucleoprotein (NP). Together, both mechanisms allow the model to capture a variety of published data sets at an unprecedented level of detail. Our findings provide theoretical support for an early regulation of replication by cRNA stabilization. However, they also suggest that the matrix protein 1 (M1) controls viral RNA levels in the late phase of infection as part of its role during the nuclear export of viral genome copies. Moreover, simulations show an accumulation of viral proteins and RNA toward the end of infection, indicating that transport processes or budding limits virion release. Thus, our mathematical model provides an ideal platform for a systematic and quantitative evaluation of influenza virus replication and its complex regulation.",

    "synopsis": "Existing models of insulin signalling focus on short term dynamics, rather than the longer term dynamics necessary to understand many physiologically relevant behaviours. We have developed a model of insulin signalling in rodent adipocytes that includes both transcriptional feedback through the Forkhead box type O (FOXO) transcription factor, and interaction with oxidative stress, in addition to the core pathway. In the model Reactive Oxygen Species are both generated endogenously and can be applied externally. They regulate signalling though inhibition of phosphatases and induction of the activity of Stress Activated Protein Kinases, which themselves modulate feedbacks to insulin signalling and FOXO.Insulin and oxidative stress combined produce a lower degree of activation of insulin signalling than insulin alone. Fasting (nutrient withdrawal) and weak oxidative stress upregulate antioxidant defences while stronger oxidative stress leads to a short term activation of insulin signalling but if prolonged can have other effects including degradation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) and FOXO. At high insulin the protective effect of moderate oxidative stress may disappear.Our model is consistent with a wide range of experimental data, some of which is difficult to explain. Oxidative stress can have effects that are both up- and down-regulatory on insulin signalling. Our model therefore shows the complexity of the interaction between the two pathways and highlights the need for such integrated computational models to give insight into the dysregulation of insulin signalling along with more data at the individual level.A complete SBML model file can be downloaded from BIOMODELS (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main) with unique identifier MODEL1212210000.Other files and scripts are available as additional files with this journal article and can be downloaded from https://github.com/graham1034/Smith2012_insulin_signalling.",

    "synopsis": "The genome of living organisms is constantly exposed to several damaging agents that induce different types of DNA lesions, leading to cellular malfunctioning and onset of many diseases. To maintain genome stability, cells developed various repair and tolerance systems to counteract the effects of DNA damage. Here we focus on Post Replication Repair (PRR), the pathway involved in the bypass of DNA lesions induced by sunlight exposure and UV radiation. PRR acts through two different mechanisms, activated by mono- and poly-ubiquitylation of the DNA sliding clamp, called Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA).We developed a novel protocol to measure the time-course ratios between mono-, di- and tri-ubiquitylated PCNA isoforms on a single western blot, which were used as the wet readout for PRR events in wild type and mutant S. cerevisiae cells exposed to acute UV radiation doses. Stochastic simulations of PCNA ubiquitylation dynamics, performed by exploiting a novel mechanistic model of PRR, well fitted the experimental data at low UV doses, but evidenced divergent behaviors at high UV doses, thus driving the design of further experiments to verify new hypothesis on the functioning of PRR. The model predicted the existence of a UV dose threshold for the proper functioning of the PRR model, and highlighted an overlapping effect of Nucleotide Excision Repair (the pathway effectively responsible to clean the genome from UV lesions) on the dynamics of PCNA ubiquitylation in different phases of the cell cycle. In addition, we showed that ubiquitin concentration can affect the rate of PCNA ubiquitylation in PRR, offering a possible explanation to the DNA damage sensitivity of yeast strains lacking deubiquitylating enzymes.We exploited an in vivo and in silico combinational approach to analyze for the first time in a Systems Biology context the events of PCNA ubiquitylation occurring in PRR in budding yeast cells. Our findings highlighted an intricate functional crosstalk between PRR and other events controlling genome stability, and evidenced that PRR is more complicated and still far less characterized than previously thought.",

    "synopsis": "Time-dependent light input is an important feature of computational models of the circadian clock. However, publicly available models encoded in standard representations such as the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) either do not encode this input or use different mechanisms to do so, which hinders reproducibility of published results as well as model reuse. The authors describe here a numerically continuous function suitable for use in SBML for models of circadian rhythms forced by periodic light-dark cycles. The Input Signal Step Function (ISSF) is broadly applicable to encoding experimental manipulations, such as drug treatments, temperature changes, or inducible transgene expression, which may be transient, periodic, or mixed. It is highly configurable and is able to reproduce a wide range of waveforms. The authors have implemented this function in SBML and demonstrated its ability to modify the behavior of publicly available models to accurately reproduce published results. The implementation of ISSF allows standard simulation software to reproduce specialized circadian protocols, such as the phase-response curve. To facilitate the reuse of this function in public models, the authors have developed software to configure its behavior without any specialist knowledge of SBML. A community-standard approach to represent the inputs that entrain circadian clock models could particularly facilitate research in chronobiology.",

    "synopsis": "Modulated immune signal (CD14-TLR and TNF) in leishmaniasis can be linked to EGFR pathway involved in wound healing, through crosstalk points. This signaling network can be further linked to a synthetic gene circuit acting as a positive feedback loop to elicit a synchronized intercellular communication among the immune cells which may contribute to a better understanding of signaling dynamics in leishmaniasis.Network reconstruction with positive feedback loop, simulation (ODE 15s solver) and sensitivity analysis of CD14-TLR, TNF and EGFR was done in SimBiology (MATLAB 7.11.1). Cytoscape and adjacency matrix were used to calculate network topology. PCA was extracted by using sensitivity coefficient in MATLAB. Model reduction was done using time, flux and sensitivity score.Network has five crosstalk points: NIK, I\u03baB-NF\u03baB and MKK (4/7, 3/6, 1/2) which show high flux and sensitivity. PI3K in EGFR pathway shows high flux and sensitivity. PCA score was high for cytoplasmic ERK1/2, PI3K, Atk, STAT1/3 and nuclear JNK. Of the 125 parameters, 20% are crucial as deduced by model reduction.EGFR can be linked to CD14-TLR and TNF through the MAPK crosstalk points. These pathways may be controlled through Ras and Raf that lie upstream of signaling components ERK \u00bd (c) and JNK (n) that have a high PCA score via a synthetic gene circuit for activating cell-cell communication to elicit an inflammatory response. Also a disease resolving effect may be achieved through PI3K in the EGFR pathway.The reconstructed signaling network can be linked to a gene circuit with a positive feedback loop, for cell-cell communication resulting in synchronized response in the immune cell population, for disease resolving effect in leishmaniasis.",

    "synopsis": ": In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation in response to nutritional sensing and stress conditions. The pathway is tightly regulated by multiple feedback loops, exerted by the protein kinase A (PKA) on a few pivotal components of the pathway. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of the second messenger cAMP by performing stochastic simulations and parameter sweep analysis of a mechanistic model of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, to determine the effects that the modulation of these feedback mechanisms has on the establishment of stable oscillatory regimes. In particular, we start by studying the role of phosphodiesterases, the enzymes that catalyze the degradation of cAMP, which represent the major negative feedback in this pathway. Then, we show the results on cAMP oscillations when perturbing the amount of protein Cdc25 coupled with the alteration of the intracellular ratio of the guanine nucleotides (GTP/GDP), which are known to regulate the switch of the GTPase Ras protein. This multi-level regulation of the amplitude and frequency of oscillations in the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway might act as a fine tuning mechanism for the downstream targets of PKA, as also recently evidenced by some experimental investigations on the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the transcription factor Msn2 in yeast cells.",

    "synopsis": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can interact with regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. However, the effects of such interactions on signal transduction and their physiological relevance have been largely undetermined. Ligand-bound GPCRs initiate by promoting exchange of GDP for GTP on the G\u03b1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Signaling is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP through intrinsic GTPase activity of the G\u03b1 subunit, a reaction catalyzed by RGS proteins. Using yeast as a tool to study GPCR signaling in isolation, we define an interaction between the cognate GPCR (Mam2) and RGS (Rgs1), mapping the interaction domains. This reaction tethers Rgs1 at the plasma membrane and is essential for physiological signaling response. In vivo quantitative data inform the development of a kinetic model of the GTPase cycle, which extends previous attempts by including GPCR-RGS interactions. In vivo and in silico data confirm that GPCR-RGS interactions can impose an additional layer of regulation through mediating RGS subcellular localization to compartmentalize RGS activity within a cell, thus highlighting their importance as potential targets to modulate GPCR signaling pathways.",

    "synopsis": "T helper (Th) cells play a major role in the immune response and pathology at the gastric mucosa during Helicobacter pylori infection. There is a limited mechanistic understanding regarding the contributions of CD4+ T cell subsets to gastritis development during H. pylori colonization. We used two computational approaches: ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based and agent-based modeling (ABM) to study the mechanisms underlying cellular immune responses to H. pylori and how CD4+ T cell subsets influenced initiation, progression and outcome of disease. To calibrate the model, in vivo experimentation was performed by infecting C57BL/6 mice intragastrically with H. pylori and assaying immune cell subsets in the stomach and gastric lymph nodes (GLN) on days 0, 7, 14, 30 and 60 post-infection. Our computational model reproduced the dynamics of effector and regulatory pathways in the gastric lamina propria (LP) in silico. Simulation results show the induction of a Th17 response and a dominant Th1 response, together with a regulatory response characterized by high levels of mucosal Treg) cells. We also investigated the potential role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) activation on the modulation of host responses to H. pylori by using loss-of-function approaches. Specifically, in silico results showed a predominance of Th1 and Th17 cells in the stomach of the cell-specific PPAR\u03b3 knockout system when compared to the wild-type simulation. Spatio-temporal, object-oriented ABM approaches suggested similar dynamics in induction of host responses showing analogous T cell distributions to ODE modeling and facilitated tracking lesion formation. In addition, sensitivity analysis predicted a crucial contribution of Th1 and Th17 effector responses as mediators of histopathological changes in the gastric mucosa during chronic stages of infection, which were experimentally validated in mice. These integrated immunoinformatics approaches characterized the induction of mucosal effector and regulatory pathways controlled by PPAR\u03b3 during H. pylori infection affecting disease outcomes.",

However, how insulin-signalling pathway selectively regulates glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, we experimentally measured metabolites in glucose metabolism in response to insulin. Step stimulation of insulin induced transient response of glycolysis and glycogenesis, and sustained response of gluconeogenesis and extracellular glucose concentration (GLC(ex)). Based on the experimental results, we constructed a simple computational model that characterises response of insulin-signalling-dependent glucose metabolism. The model revealed that the network motifs of glycolysis and glycogenesis pathways constitute a feedforward (FF) with substrate depletion and incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL), respectively, enabling glycolysis and glycogenesis responsive to temporal changes of insulin rather than its absolute concentration. In contrast, the network motifs of gluconeogenesis pathway constituted a FF inhibition, enabling gluconeogenesis responsive to absolute concentration of insulin regardless of its temporal patterns. GLC(ex) was regulated by gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. These results demonstrate the selective control mechanism of glucose metabolism by temporal patterns of insulin.",

    "synopsis": "Stochasticity plays important roles in many molecular networks when molecular concentrations are in the range of 0.1 muM to 10nM (about 100 to 10 copies in a cell). The chemical master equation provides a fundamental framework for studying these networks, and the time-varying landscape probability distribution over the full microstates, i.e., the combination of copy numbers of molecular species, provide a full characterization of the network dynamics. A complete characterization of the space of the microstates is a prerequisite for obtaining the full landscape probability distribution of a network. However, there are neither closed-form solutions nor algorithms fully describing all microstates for a given molecular network.We have developed an algorithm that can exhaustively enumerate the microstates of a molecular network of small copy numbers under the condition that the net gain in newly synthesized molecules is smaller than a predefined limit. We also describe a simple method for computing the exact mean or steady state landscape probability distribution over microstates. We show how the full landscape probability for the gene networks of the self-regulating gene and the toggle-switch in the steady state can be fully characterized. We also give an example using the MAPK cascade network. Data and server will be available at URL: http://scsb.sjtu.edu.cn/statespace.Our algorithm works for networks of small copy numbers buffered with a finite copy number of net molecules that can be synthesized, regardless of the reaction stoichiometry, and is optimal in both storage and time complexity. The algorithm can also be used to calculate the rates of all transitions between microstates from given reactions and reaction rates. The buffer size is limited by the available memory or disk storage. Our algorithm is applicable to a class of biological networks when the copy numbers of molecules are small and the network is closed, or the network is open but the net gain in newly synthesized molecules does not exceed a predefined buffer capacity. For these networks, our method allows full stochastic characterization of the mean landscape probability distribution, and the steady state when it exists.",

    "synopsis": "Progress in the development of therapeutic interventions to treat or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease has been hampered by lack of efficacy and unforeseen side effects in human clinical trials. This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we extended this model to include the main processes involved in passive and active immunisation against A\u03b2 and then demonstrate the effects of this intervention on soluble A\u03b2, plaques, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in small reductions in levels of soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by neuropathological observations in Alzheimer patients immunised against A\u03b2. Since, soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our model suggests that immunotherapy against A\u03b2 may not be effective unless it is performed very early in the disease process or combined with other therapies.",

    "synopsis": "Preterm birth is the single biggest cause of significant neonatal morbidity and mortality, and the incidence is rising. Development of new therapies to treat and prevent preterm labour is seriously hampered by incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that initiate labour at term and preterm. Computational modelling provides a new opportunity to improve this understanding. It is a useful tool in (i) identifying gaps in knowledge and informing future research, and (ii) providing the basis for an in silico model of parturition in which novel drugs to prevent or treat preterm labour can be \"tested\". Despite their merits, computational models are rarely used to study the molecular events initiating labour. Here, we present the first attempt to generate a dynamic kinetic model that has relevance to the molecular mechanisms of preterm labour. Using published data, we model an important candidate signalling pathway in infection-induced preterm labour: that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced activation of Nuclear Factor kappa B. This is the first model of this pathway to explicitly include molecular interactions upstream of Nuclear Factor kappa B activation. We produced a formalised graphical depiction of the pathway and built a kinetic model based on ordinary differential equations. The kinetic model accurately reproduced published in vitro time course plots of Lipopolysaccharide-induced Nuclear Factor kappa B activation in mouse embryo fibroblasts. In this preliminary work we have provided proof of concept that it is possible to build computational models of signalling pathways that are relevant to the regulation of labour, and suggest that models that are validated with wet-lab experiments have the potential to greatly benefit the field.",

    "synopsis": "Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) inhibitor, displays complex pharmaokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) behavior. Available clinical data indicate a lack of dose-bronchodilatory response during initial treatment, with a dose response developing after ~1-2 weeks. We developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon. The model described the release, maturation, and trafficking of eosinophils into the airways, leukotriene synthesis by the 5LO enzyme, leukotriene signaling and bronchodilation, and the PK of zileuton. The model provided a plausible explanation for the two-phase bronchodilatory effect of zileuton-the short-term bronchodilation was due to leukotriene inhibition and the long-term bronchodilation was due to inflammatory cell infiltration blockade. The model also indicated that the theoretical maximum bronchodilation of both 5LO inhibition and leukotriene receptor blockade is likely similar. QSP modeling provided interesting insights into the effects of leukotriene modulation.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e74; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.49; advance online publication 11 September 2013.",

    "synopsis": "Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to bone and other tissue cells, but their differentiation still escapes full control. In this paper we address this issue by mathematical modeling. We present a model for a genetic switch determining the cell fate of progenitor cells which can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone cells) or chondrocytes (cartilage cells). The model consists of two switch mechanisms and reproduces the experimentally observed three stable equilibrium states: a progenitor, an osteogenic, and a chondrogenic state. Conventionally, the loss of an intermediate (progenitor) state and the entailed attraction to one of two opposite (differentiated) states is modeled as a result of changing parameters. In our model in contrast, we achieve this by distributing the differentiation process to two functional switch parts acting in concert: one triggering differentiation and the other determining cell fate. Via stability and bifurcation analysis, we investigate the effects of biochemical stimuli associated with different system inputs. We employ our model to generate differentiation scenarios on the single cell as well as on the cell population level. The single cell scenarios allow to reconstruct the switching upon extrinsic signals, whereas the cell population scenarios provide a framework to identify the impact of intrinsic properties and the limiting factors for successful differentiation.",

Compared to earlier human cycle models, there are three important differences: The model presented here (a) does not involve any delay equations, (b) is based on a deterministic modeling of the GnRH pulse pattern, and (c) contains less differential equations and less parameters. These differences allow for a faster simulation and parameter identification. The focus is on modeling GnRH-receptor binding, in particular, by inclusion of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for a GnRH agonist, Nafarelin, and a GnRH antagonist, Cetrorelix, into the menstrual cycle model. The final mathematical model describes the hormone profiles (LH, FSH, P4, E2) throughout the menstrual cycle of 12 healthy women. It correctly predicts hormonal changes following single and multiple dose administration of Nafarelin or Cetrorelix at different stages in the cycle.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Plasmodium is the causal parasite of malaria, infectious disease responsible for the death of up to one million people each year. Glycerophospholipid and consequently membrane biosynthesis are essential for the survival of the parasite and are targeted by a new class of antimalarial drugs developed in our lab. In order to understand the highly redundant phospholipid synthethic pathways and eventual mechanism of resistance to various drugs, an organism specific kinetic model of these metabolic pathways need to be developed in Plasmodium species. RESULTS: Fluxomic data were used to build a quantitative kinetic model of glycerophospholipid pathways in Plasmodium knowlesi. In vitro incorporation dynamics of phospholipids unravels multiple synthetic pathways. A detailed metabolic network with values of the kinetic parameters (maximum rates and Michaelis constants) has been built. In order to obtain a global search in the parameter space, we have designed a hybrid, discrete and continuous, optimization method. Discrete parameters were used to sample the cone of admissible fluxes, whereas the continuous Michaelis and maximum rates constants were obtained by local minimization of an objective function.The model was used to predict the distribution of fluxes within the network of various metabolic precursors.The quantitative analysis was used to understand eventual links between different pathways. The major source of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the CDP-choline Kennedy pathway.In silico knock-out experiments showed comparable importance of phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) and phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) for PC synthesis.The flux values indicate that, major part of serine derived phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is formed via serine decarboxylation, whereas major part of phosphatidylserine (PS) is formed by base-exchange reactions.Sensitivity analysis of CDP-choline pathway shows that the carrier-mediated choline entry into the parasite and the phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase reaction have the largest sensitivity coefficients in this pathway, but does not distinguish a reaction as an unique rate-limiting step. CONCLUSION: We provide a fully parametrized kinetic model for the multiple phospholipid synthetic pathways in P. knowlesi. This model has been used to clarify the relative importance of the various reactions in these metabolic pathways. Future work extensions of this modelling strategy will serve to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing the development of Plasmodium during its blood stages, as well as the mechanisms of action of drugs on membrane biosynthetic pathways and eventual mechanisms of resistance.",

    "synopsis": "Iron is essential for all known life due to its redox properties; however, these same properties can also lead to its toxicity in overload through the production of reactive oxygen species. Robust systemic and cellular control are required to maintain safe levels of iron, and the liver seems to be where this regulation is mainly located. Iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases, and as our understanding of iron metabolism improves, the list of iron-related disorders grows. Recent developments have resulted in greater knowledge of the fate of iron in the body and have led to a detailed map of its metabolism; however, a quantitative understanding at the systems level of how its components interact to produce tight regulation remains elusive. A mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism, which includes the core regulatory components, is presented here. It was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and on their kinetic properties, obtained from several publications. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data, and it is able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the simulation was found to recreate the dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. A disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The simulation provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. This model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve further our knowledge of this system.",

    "synopsis": "Understanding the complex dynamics of growth factor signaling requires both mechanistic and kinetic information. Although signaling dynamics have been studied for pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors, they have not been investigated for the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily pathways. Using an integrative experimental and mathematical modeling approach, we dissected the dynamic behavior of the TGF-\u03b2 to Smad pathway, which is mediated by type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases, in response to acute, chronic, and repeated ligand stimulations. TGF-\u03b2 exposure produced a transient response that attenuated over time, resulting in desensitized cells that were refractory to further acute stimulation. This loss of signaling competence depended on ligand binding, but not on receptor activity, and was restored only after the ligand had been depleted. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2 binding triggered the rapid depletion of signaling-competent receptors from the cell surface, with the type I and type II receptors exhibiting different degradation and trafficking kinetics. A computational model of TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction from the membrane to the nucleus that incorporates our experimental findings predicts that autocrine signaling, such as that associated with tumorigenesis, severely compromises the TGF-\u03b2 response, which we confirmed experimentally. Thus, we have shown that the long-term signaling behavior of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway is determined by receptor dynamics, does not require TGF-\u03b2-induced gene expression, and influences context-dependent responses in vivo.",

    "synopsis": "Objective. To use a novel computational approach to examine the molecular pathways involved in cartilage breakdown and to use computer simulation to test possible interventions to reduce collagen release. Methods. We constructed a computational model of the relevant molecular pathways using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a computer-readable format of a biochemical network. The model was constructed using our experimental data showing that interleukin-1 (IL-1) and oncostatin M (OSM) act synergistically to up-regulate collagenase protein and activity and initiate cartilage collagen breakdown. Simulations were performed in the COPASI software package. Results. The model predicted that simulated inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and over-expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP-3) led to a reduction in collagen release. Over-expression of TIMP-1 was much less effective than TIMP-3 and led to a delay, rather than a reduction, in collagen release. Simulated interventions of receptor antagonists and inhibition of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), the first kinase in the OSM pathway, were ineffective. So, importantly, the model predicts that it is more effective to intervene at targets which are downstream, such as the JNK pathway, rather than close to the cytokine signal. In vitro experiments confirmed the effectiveness of JNK inhibition. Conclusion. Our study shows the value of computer modelling as a tool for examining possible interventions to reduce cartilage collagen breakdown. The model predicts interventions that either prevent transcription or inhibit activity of collagenases are promising strategies and should be investigated further in an experimental setting. \u00a9 2013 American College of Rheumatology.",

To obtain insight into the network dynamics of fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation, we constructed a detailed computational model of the pathway and subjected it to a fat overload condition. The model contains reversible and saturable enzyme-kinetic equations and experimentally determined parameters for rat-liver enzymes.

Subsequently, we simulated the condition of obesity by increasing the palmitoyl-CoA concentration. At a high concentration of palmitoyl CoA the \u03b2-oxidation became overloaded: the flux dropped and metabolites accumulated. This behavior originated from the competition between acyl CoAs of different chain lengths for a set of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases with overlapping substrate specificity. This effectively induced competitive feedforward inhibition and thereby led to accumulation of CoA-ester intermediates and depletion of free CoA (CoASH). The mitochondrial [NAD\u207a]/[NADH] ratio modulated the sensitivity to substrate overload, revealing a tight interplay between regulation of \u03b2-oxidation and mitochondrial respiration.",

    "synopsis": "It has been proposed' that gene-regulatory circuits with virtually any desired property can be constructed from networks of simple regulatory elements. These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage lambda switch and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.",

    "synopsis": "Most neocortical neurons formed during embryonic brain development arise from radial glial cells which communicate, in part, via ATP mediated calcium signals. Although the intercellular signalling mechanisms that regulate radial glia proliferation are not well understood, it has recently been demonstrated that ATP dependent intracellular calcium release leads to an increase of nearly 100% in overall cellular proliferation. It has been hypothesised that cytoplasmic calcium accelerates entry into S phase of the cell cycle and/or acts to recruit otherwise quiescent cells onto the cell cycle. In this paper we study this cell cycle acceleration and recruitment by forming a differential equation model for ATP mediated calcium-cell cycle coupling via Cyclin D in a single radial glial cell. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations suggest that the cell cycle period depends only weakly on cytoplasmic calcium. Therefore, the accelerative impact of calcium on the cell cycle can only account for a small fraction of the large increase in proliferation observed experimentally. Crucially however, our bifurcation analysis reveals that stable fixed point and stable limit cycle solutions can coexist, and that calcium dependent Cyclin D dynamics extend the oscillatory region to lower Cyclin D synthesis rates, thus rendering cells more susceptible to cycling. This supports the hypothesis that cycling glial cells recruit quiescent cells (in G0 phase) onto the cell cycle, via a calcium signalling mechanism, and that this may be the primary means by which calcium augments proliferation rates at the population scale. Numerical simulations of two coupled cells demonstrate that such a scenario is indeed feasible.",

In 2011, PF-04457845, an irreversible inhibitor of FAAH, was progressed to phase II clinical trials for osteoarthritic pain. This article discusses a prospective, integrated systems pharmacology model evaluation of FAAH as a target for pain in humans, using physiologically based pharmacokinetic and systems biology approaches. The model integrated physiological compartments; endocannabinoid production, degradation, and disposition data; PF-04457845 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and cannabinoid receptor CB1-binding kinetics. The modeling identified clear gaps in our understanding and highlighted key risks going forward, in particular relating to whether methods are in place to demonstrate target engagement and pharmacological effect. The value of this modeling exercise will be discussed in detail and in the context of the clinical phase II data, together with recommendations to enable optimal future evaluation of FAAH inhibitors.CPT: Pharmacometrics Systems Pharmacology (2014) 3, e91; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.72; published online 15 January 2014.",

    "synopsis": "PURPOSE: To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter (MTD) data from 21 patients treated with first-line procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential equations, incorporating tumor-specific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in 24 patients treated with first-line temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with first-line radiotherapy. RESULTS: The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG before, during, and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics in LGG patients treated with TMZ chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data. CONCLUSIONS: Using MTD data, we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describe LGG tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules.",

    "synopsis": "As multicellular organisms grow, positional information is continually needed to regulate the pattern in which cells are arranged. In the Arabidopsis root, most cell types are organized in a radially symmetric pattern; however, a symmetry-breaking event generates bisymmetric auxin and cytokinin signaling domains in the stele. Bidirectional cross-talk between the stele and the surrounding tissues involving a mobile transcription factor, SHORT ROOT (SHR), and mobile microRNA species also determines vascular pattern, but it is currently unclear how these signals integrate. We use a multicellular model to determine a minimal set of components necessary for maintaining a stable vascular pattern. Simulations perturbing the signaling network show that, in addition to the mutually inhibitory interaction between auxin and cytokinin, signaling through SHR, microRNA165/6, and PHABULOSA is required to maintain a stable bisymmetric pattern. We have verified this prediction by observing loss of bisymmetry in shr mutants. The model reveals the importance of several features of the network, namely the mutual degradation of microRNA165/6 and PHABULOSA and the existence of an additional negative regulator of cytokinin signaling. These components form a plausible mechanism capable of patterning vascular tissues in the absence of positional inputs provided by the transport of hormones from the shoot.",

    "synopsis": "In vivo, antibiotics are often much less efficient than ex vivo and relapses can occur. The reasons for poor in vivo activity are still not completely understood. We have studied the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin in an animal model for complicated Salmonellosis. High-dose ciprofloxacin treatment efficiently reduced pathogen loads in feces and most organs. However, the cecum draining lymph node (cLN), the gut tissue, and the spleen retained surviving bacteria. In cLN, approximately 10%-20% of the bacteria remained viable. These phenotypically tolerant bacteria lodged mostly within CD103\u207aCX\u2083CR1\u207bCD11c\u207a dendritic cells, remained genetically susceptible to ciprofloxacin, were sufficient to reinitiate infection after the end of the therapy, and displayed an extremely slow growth rate, as shown by mathematical analysis of infections with mixed inocula and segregative plasmid experiments. The slow growth was sufficient to explain recalcitrance to antibiotics treatment. Therefore, slow-growing antibiotic-tolerant bacteria lodged within dendritic cells can explain poor in vivo antibiotic activity and relapse. Administration of LPS or CpG, known elicitors of innate immune defense, reduced the loads of tolerant bacteria. Thus, manipulating innate immunity may augment the in vivo activity of antibiotics.",

    "synopsis": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an integral part of gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Recently, it has been shown that pairs of miRNAs can repress the translation of a target mRNA in a cooperative manner, which leads to an enhanced effectiveness and specificity in target repression. However, it remains unclear which miRNA pairs can synergize and which genes are target of cooperative miRNA regulation. In this paper, we present a computational workflow for the prediction and analysis of cooperating miRNAs and their mutual target genes, which we refer to as RNA triplexes. The workflow integrates methods of miRNA target prediction; triplex structure analysis; molecular dynamics simulations and mathematical modeling for a reliable prediction of functional RNA triplexes and target repression efficiency. In a case study we analyzed the human genome and identified several thousand targets of cooperative gene regulation. Our results suggest that miRNA cooperativity is a frequent mechanism for an enhanced target repression by pairs of miRNAs facilitating distinctive and fine-tuned target gene expression patterns. Human RNA triplexes predicted and characterized in this study are organized in a web resource at www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/triplexrna/.",

    "synopsis": "Associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, or prion diseases, the conversion of soluble proteins into amyloid fibrils remains poorly understood. Extensive \"in vitro\" measurements of protein aggregation kinetics have been reported, but no consensus mechanism has emerged until now. This contribution aims at overcoming this gap by proposing a theoretically consistent crystallization-like model (CLM) that is able to describe the classic types of amyloid fibrillization kinetics identified in our literature survey. Amyloid conversion represented as a function of time is shown to follow different curve shapes, ranging from sigmoidal to hyperbolic, according to the relative importance of the nucleation and growth steps. Using the CLM, apparently unrelated data are deconvoluted into generic mechanistic information integrating the combined influence of seeding, nucleation, growth, and fibril breakage events. It is notable that this complex assembly of interdependent events is ultimately reduced to a mathematically simple model, whose two parameters can be determined by little more than visual inspection. The good fitting results obtained for all cases confirm the CLM as a good approximation to the generalized underlying principle governing amyloid fibrillization. A perspective is presented on possible applications of the CLM during the development of new targets for amyloid disease therapeutics.",

In some cases, e.g. fibrillar deposits of insulin, the problems are generated in the processes of production and purification of protein and in the pump devices or injectable preparations for diabetics. Experimental kinetics and adequate modelling of chemical inhibition from amyloid aggregation are of practical importance in order to study the viable processing, formulation and storage as well as to predict and optimize the best conditions to reduce the effect of protein nucleation. RESULTS: In this manuscript, experimental data of insulin, A\u03b242 amyloid protein and apomyoglobin fibrillation from recent bibliography were selected to evaluate the capability of a bivariate sigmoid equation to model them. The mathematical functions (logistic combined with Weibull equation) were used in reparameterized form and the effect of inhibitor concentrations on kinetic parameters from logistic equation were perfectly defined and explained. The surfaces of data were accurately described by proposed model and the presented analysis characterized the inhibitory influence on the protein aggregation by several chemicals. Discrimination between true and apparent inhibitors was also confirmed by the bivariate equation. EGCG for insulin (working at pH\u2009=\u20097.4/T\u2009=\u200937\u00b0C) and taiwaniaflavone for A\u03b242 were the compounds studied that shown the greatest inhibition capacity. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate, simple and effective model to investigate the inhibition of chemicals on amyloid protein aggregation has been developed. The equation could be useful for the clear quantification of inhibitor potential of chemicals and rigorous comparison among them.",

Based upon experimental data, we have developed a mathematical model for the reaction pathways and determined rate parameters for peptide secondary structural conversion and aggregation during the entire fibrillogenesis process from random coil to mature fibrils, including the molecular species that accelerate the conversions. The model and the rate parameters include different molecular structural stages in the nucleation and polymerization processes and the numerical solutions yield graphs of concentrations of different molecular species versus time that are in close agreement with experimental results. The model also allows for the calculation of the time-dependent increase in aggregate size. The calculated results agree well with experimental results, and allow differences in experimental conditions to be included in the calculations. The specific steps of the model and the rate constants that are determined by fitting to experimental data provide insight on the molecular species involved in the fibril formation process.",

    "synopsis": "In genetic disorders associated with premature neuronal death, symptoms may not appear for years or decades. This delay in clinical onset is often assumed to reflect the occurrence of age-dependent cumulative damage. For example, it has been suggested that oxidative stress disrupts metabolism in neurological degenerative disorders by the cumulative damage of essential macromolecules. A prediction of the cumulative damage hypothesis is that the probability of cell death will increase over time. Here we show in contrast that the kinetics of neuronal death in 12 models of photoreceptor degeneration, hippocampal neurons undergoing excitotoxic cell death, a mouse model of cerebellar degeneration and Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are all exponential and better explained by mathematical models in which the risk of cell death remains constant or decreases exponentially with age. These kinetics argue against the cumulative damage hypothesis; instead, the time of death of any neuron is random. Our findings are most simply accommodated by a 'one-hit' biochemical model in which mutation imposes a mutant steady state on the neuron and a single event randomly initiates cell death. This model appears to be common to many forms of neurodegeneration and has implications for therapeutic strategies.",

Here, we propose and mathematically study a model of the MFL and show that, by itself, it can serve both as a bistable switch and as a clock (an oscillator) depending on kinetic parameters. The MFL phase diagram as well as a detailed description of the nonlinear oscillation regime are presented and some biological examples are discussed. The results emphasize the role of protein interactions in the function of genetic modules and the usefulness of modeling RNA dynamics explicitly.",

We used a systems biology approach to study tau aggregation, one of the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease. A mathematical model was constructed to capture the current state of knowledge concerning tau's behavior and interactions in cells. The model was implemented in silico in the form of ordinary differential equations. The identifiability of the model was assessed and parameters were estimated to generate two cellular states: a population of solutions that corresponds to normal tau homeostasis and a population of solutions that displays aggregation-prone behavior. The model of normal tau homeostasis was robust to perturbations, and disturbances in multiple processes were required to achieve an aggregation-prone state. The aggregation-prone state was ultrasensitive to perturbations in diverse subsets of networks. Tau aggregation requires that multiple cellular parameters are set coordinately to a set of values that drive pathological assembly of tau. This model provides a foundation on which to build and increase our understanding of the series of events that lead to tau aggregation and may ultimately be used to identify critical intervention points that can direct the cell away from tau aggregation to aid in the treatment of tau-mediated (or related) aggregation diseases including Alzheimer's.",

The cellular responses to both cytokines are activated via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. During the past 10 years, the crosstalk mechanism between the IFN-gamma and IL-6 pathways has been studied widely and several biological hypotheses have been proposed, but the kinetics and detailed crosstalk mechanism remain unclear. RESULTS: Using established mathematical models and new experimental observations of the crosstalk between the IFN-gamma and IL-6 pathways, we constructed a new crosstalk model that considers three possible crosstalk levels: (1) the competition between STAT1 and STAT3 for common receptor docking sites; (2) the mutual negative regulation between SOCS1 and SOCS3; and (3) the negative regulatory effects of the formation of STAT1/3 heterodimers. A number of simulations were tested to explore the consequences of cross-regulation between the two pathways. The simulation results agreed well with the experimental data, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness and correctness of the model. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a crosstalk model of the IFN-gamma and IL-6 pathways to theoretically investigate their cross-regulation mechanism. The simulation experiments showed the importance of the three crosstalk levels between the two pathways. In particular, the unbalanced competition between STAT1 and STAT3 for IFNR and gp130 led to preferential activation of IFN-gamma and IL-6, while at the same time the formation of STAT1/3 heterodimers enhanced preferential signal transduction by sequestering a fraction of the activated STATs.

    "synopsis": "Long-wavelength and low-fluence UV-B light is an informational signal known to induce photomorphogenic development in plants. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a variety of factors involved in UV-B-specific signaling have been experimentally characterized over the past decade, including the UV-B light receptor UV resistance locus 8; the positive regulators constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 and elongated hypocotyl 5; and the negative regulators cullin4, repressor of UV-B photomorphogenesis 1 (RUP1), and RUP2. Individual genetic and molecular studies have revealed that these proteins function in either positive or negative regulatory capacities for the sufficient and balanced transduction of photomorphogenic UV-B signal. Less is known, however, regarding how these signaling events are systematically linked. In our study, we use a systems biology approach to investigate the dynamic behaviors and correlations of multiple signaling components involved in Arabidopsis UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis. We define a mathematical representation of photomorphogenic UV-B signaling at a temporal scale. Supplemented with experimental validation, our computational modeling demonstrates the functional interaction that occurs among different protein complexes in early and prolonged response to photomorphogenic UV-B.",

    "synopsis": "Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a public health threat. However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these issues, we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target (epithelial) cells, influenza virus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and virus-specific IgG and IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of 340 mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response (before day 5), the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is approximately 1.2 days, and the half-life of free infectious IAV is approximately 4 h. During the adaptive immune response (after day 5), the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is approximately 0.5 days, and the average half-life of free infectious virus is approximately 1.8 min. During the adaptive phase, model fitting confirms that CD8(+) CTLs are crucial for limiting infected cells, while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. Also, simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance. This study provides a basis to better understand and predict influenza virus immunity.",

    "synopsis": "Arsenic has a dual role as causative and curative agent of human disease. Therefore, there is considerable interest in elucidating arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms. By an ensemble modelling approach, we identified a best parsimonious mathematical model which recapitulates and predicts intracellular arsenic dynamics for different conditions and mutants, thereby providing novel insights into arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms in yeast, which could partly be confirmed experimentally by dedicated experiments. Specifically, our analyses suggest that: (i) arsenic is mainly protein-bound during short-term (acute) exposure, whereas glutathione-conjugated arsenic dominates during long-term (chronic) exposure, (ii) arsenic is not stably retained, but can leave the vacuole via an export mechanism, and (iii) Fps1 is controlled by Hog1-dependent and Hog1-independent mechanisms during arsenite stress. Our results challenge glutathione depletion as a key mechanism for arsenic toxicity and instead suggest that (iv) increased glutathione biosynthesis protects the proteome against the damaging effects of arsenic and that (v) widespread protein inactivation contributes to the toxicity of this metalloid. Our work in yeast may prove useful to elucidate similar mechanisms in higher eukaryotes and have implications for the use of arsenic in medical therapy.",

    "synopsis": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is evidence that alpha-synuclein (alphaSN) aggregation is coupled to dysfunctional or overburdened protein quality control systems, in particular the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we develop a simple dynamical model for the on-going conflict between alphaSN aggregation and the maintenance of a functional proteasome in the healthy cell, based on the premise that proteasomal activity can be titrated out by mature alphaSN fibrils and their protofilament precursors. In the presence of excess proteasomes the cell easily maintains homeostasis. However, when the ratio between the available proteasome and the alphaSN protofilaments is reduced below a threshold level, we predict a collapse of homeostasis and onset of oscillations in the proteasome concentration. Depleted proteasome opens for accumulation of oligomers. Our analysis suggests that the onset of PD is associated with a proteasome population that becomes occupied in periodic degradation of aggregates. This behavior is found to be the general state of a proteasome/chaperone system under pressure, and suggests new interpretations of other diseases where protein aggregation could stress elements of the protein quality control system.",

    "synopsis": "Aggregation of the small peptide amyloid beta (A\u03b2) into oligomers and fibrils in the brain is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 is produced via multiple proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mediated by the enzymes \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. In this study, we examine the temporal dynamics of soluble (unaggregated) A\u03b2 in the plasma and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) of rhesus monkeys treated with different oral doses of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor. A dose-dependent reduction of A\u03b2 concentration was observed within hours of drug ingestion, for all doses tested. A\u03b2 concentration in the CSF returned to its predrug level over the monitoring period. In contrast, A\u03b2 concentration in the plasma exhibited an unexpected overshoot to as high as 200% of the predrug concentration, and this overshoot persisted as late as 72 hours post-drug ingestion. To account for these observations, we proposed and analyzed a minimal physiological model for A\u03b2 dynamics that could fit the data. Our analysis suggests that the overshoot arises from the attenuation of an A\u03b2 clearance mechanism, possibly due to the inhibitor. Our model predicts that the efficacy of A\u03b2 clearance recovers to its basal (pretreatment) value with a characteristic time of >48 hours, matching the time-scale of the overshoot. These results point to the need for a more detailed investigation of soluble A\u03b2 clearance mechanisms and their interaction with A\u03b2-reducing drugs.",

We describe each mechanism with a differential equation, and then solve the two equations numerically. The solution provides a description of the time course of the reduction of acetylcholine in AD patients that is consistent with epidemiological data.

According to the hypothesis, an increase in beta-amyloid concentration caused by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein results in an increase in the leakage of choline out of cells. This leads to a reduction in intracellular choline concentration and hence a reduction in acetylcholine production. The reduction in acetylcholine production, in turn, causes an increase in the concentration of beta-amyloid. The resultant positive feedback between decreased acetylcholine and increased beta-amyloid accelerates the loss of acetylcholine. We compare the predictions of the choline-leakage hypothesis with a number of experimental observations. We also approximate it with a pair of ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations indicate that the loss of acetylcholine is very sensitive to the initial rate of beta-amyloid production.",

Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.",

The overall process of protein aggregation is characterized by initial lag time during which no detectable aggregation occurs in the solution and by maximal aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein converts into aggregates. In this study, the correlation between the lag time and the maximal rate of protein aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these two quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the kinetic index of the curve quantifying the time evolution of the fraction of protein aggregated. As this index depends relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied, our finding provides insight into why for many experiments the values of the product of the lag time and the maximal aggregation rate are often equal or quite close to each other. It is shown how the kinetic index is related to a basic kinetic parameter of a recently proposed theory of protein aggregation.",

    "synopsis": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is produced by the consecutive cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) first by \u03b2-secretase, generating C99, and then by \u03b3-secretase. APP is also cleaved by \u03b1-secretase. It is hypothesized that reducing the production of A\u03b2 in the brain may slow the progression of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, different \u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been developed to reduce A\u03b2 production. Paradoxically, it has been shown that low to moderate inhibitor concentrations cause a rise in A\u03b2 production in different cell lines, in different animal models, and also in humans. A mechanistic understanding of the A\u03b2 rise remains elusive. Here, a minimal mathematical model has been developed that quantitatively describes the A\u03b2 dynamics in cell lines that exhibit the rise as well as in cell lines that do not. The model includes steps of APP processing through both the so-called amyloidogenic pathway and the so-called non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is shown that the cross-talk between these two pathways accounts for the increase in A\u03b2 production in response to inhibitor, i.e. an increase in C99 will inhibit the non-amyloidogenic pathway, redirecting APP to be cleaved by \u03b2-secretase, leading to an additional increase in C99 that overcomes the loss in \u03b3-secretase activity. With a minor extension, the model also describes plasma A\u03b2 profiles observed in humans upon dosing with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor. In conclusion, this mechanistic model rationalizes a series of experimental results that spans from in vitro to in vivo and to humans. This has important implications for the development of drugs targeting A\u03b2 production in Alzheimer disease.",

We used predictive-model simulation to test several hypotheses for possible modes of STYX action. We show that STYX localizes to the nucleus, competes with nuclear DUSP4 for binding to ERK, and acts as a nuclear anchor that regulates ERK nuclear export. Depletion of STYX increases ERK activity in both cytosol and nucleus. Importantly, depletion of STYX causes an ERK-dependent fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and inhibits Golgi polarization and directional cell migration. Finally, we show that overexpression of STYX reduces ERK1/2 activation, thereby blocking PC12 cell differentiation. Overall, our results identify STYX as an important regulator of ERK1/2 signaling critical for cell migration and PC12 cell differentiation.",

    "synopsis": "Previous article on the integrative modelling of Parkinson's disease (PD) described a mathematical model with properties suggesting that PD pathogenesis is associated with a feedback-induced biochemical bistability. In this article, the authors show that the dynamics of the mathematical model can be extracted and distilled into an equivalent two-state feedback motif whose stability properties are controlled by multi-factorial combinations of risk factors and genetic mutations associated with PD. Based on this finding, the authors propose a principle for PD pathogenesis in the form of the switch-like transition of a bistable feedback process from 'healthy' homeostatic levels of reactive oxygen species and the protein \u03b1-synuclein, to an alternative 'disease' state in which concentrations of both molecules are stable at the damagingly high-levels associated with PD. The bistability is analysed using the rate curves and steady-state response characteristics of the feedback motif. In particular, the authors show how a bifurcation in the feedback motif marks the pathogenic moment at which the 'healthy' state is lost and the 'disease' state is initiated. Further analysis shows how known risks (such as: age, toxins and genetic predisposition) modify the stability characteristics of the feedback motif in a way that is compatible with known features of PD, and which explain properties such as: multi-factorial causality, variability in susceptibility and severity, multi-timescale progression and the special cases of familial Parkinson's and Parkinsonian symptoms induced purely by toxic stress.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is central in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Converging pieces of evidence suggest that the levels of ASYN expression play a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. ASYN fibrils are the main component of inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs) which are found mainly in the surviving neurons of the substantia nigra. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the involvement of ASYN in molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PD, there is much information missing which prevents understanding the causes of the disease and how to stop its progression. RESULTS: Using a Systems Biology approach, we develop a biomolecular reactions model that describes the intracellular ASYN dynamics in relation to overexpression, post-translational modification, oligomerization and degradation of the protein. Especially for the proteolysis of ASYN, the model takes into account the biological knowledge regarding the contribution of Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA), macro-autophagic and proteasome pathways in the protein's degradation. Importantly, inhibitory phenomena, caused by ASYN, concerning CMA (more specifically the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a, abbreviated as Lamp2a receptor, which is the rate limiting step of CMA) and the proteasome are carefully modeled. The model is validated by simulation studies of known experimental overexpression data from SH-SY5Y cells and the unknown model parameters are estimated either computationally or by experimental fitting. The calibrated model is then tested under three hypothetical intervention scenarios and in all cases predicts increased cell viability that agrees with experimental evidence. The biomodel has been annotated and is made available in SBML format. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model presented here successfully simulates the dynamic phenomena of ASYN overexpression and oligomerization and predicts the biological system's behavior in a number of scenarios not used for model calibration. It allows, for the first time, to qualitatively estimate the protein levels that are capable of deregulating proteolytic homeostasis. In addition, it can help form new hypotheses for intervention that could be tested experimentally.",

Sections were stained with H&E, Safranin-O, Picro-sirius red and antibodies to matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), nitrotyrosine, LC-3B, Bcl-2, and cleaved type II collagen used for immunohistochemistry. Based on this and other data from the literature, a computer simulation model was built using the Systems Biology Markup Language using an iterative approach of data analysis and modelling. Individual parameters were subsequently altered to assess their effect on the model.A progressive loss of cartilage matrix occurred with age. Nitrotyrosine, MMP-13 and activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK1) staining in cartilage increased with age with a concomitant decrease in LC-3B and Bcl-2. Stochastic simulations from the computational model showed a good agreement with these data, once transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signalling via ALK1/ALK5 receptors was included. Oxidative stress and the interleukin 1 pathway were identified as key factors in driving the cartilage breakdown associated with ageing.A progressive loss of cartilage matrix and cellularity occurs with age. This is accompanied with increased levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis and MMP-13 and a decrease in chondrocyte autophagy. These changes explain the marked predisposition of joints to develop osteoarthritis with age. Computational modelling provides useful insights into the underlying mechanisms involved in age-related changes in musculoskeletal tissues.",

According to the recently proposed Crystallization-Like Model, the kinetics of amyloid fibrillization can be retarded by decreasing the frequency of new fibril formation or by decreasing the elongation rate of existing fibrils. To the compounds that affect the nucleation and/or the growth steps we call true inhibitors. An apparent inhibition mechanism may however result from the alteration of thermodynamic properties such as the solubility of the amyloidogenic protein. Apparent inhibitors markedly influence protein aggregation kinetics measured in vitro, yet they are likely to lead to disappointing results when tested in vivo. This is because cells and tissues media are in general much more buffered against small variations in composition than the solutions prepared in lab. Here we show how to discriminate between true and apparent inhibition mechanisms from experimental data on protein aggregation kinetics.

    "synopsis": "Qualitative frameworks, especially those based on the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to model regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of these frameworks is that they do not require precise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large networks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools that provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative models has been missing.We present the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative Models Package (\"qual\"), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed for computer representation of qualitative models of biological networks. We demonstrate the interoperability of models via SBML qual through the analysis of a specific signalling network by three independent software tools. Furthermore, the collective effort to define the SBML qual format paved the way for the development of LogicalModel, an open-source model library, which will facilitate the adoption of the format as well as the collaborative development of algorithms to analyse qualitative models.SBML qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a number of complementary software tools. SBML qual has the potential to promote collaborative work on the development of novel computational approaches, as well as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive qualitative models of regulatory and signalling networks.",

    "synopsis": "Circadian clocks exhibit 'temperature compensation', meaning that they show only small changes in period over a broad temperature range. Several clock genes have been implicated in the temperature-dependent control of period in Arabidopsis. We show that blue light is essential for this, suggesting that the effects of light and temperature interact or converge upon common targets in the circadian clock. Our data demonstrate that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the physiological temperature range. In order to test the hypothesis that the targets of light regulation are sufficient to mediate temperature compensation, we constructed a temperature-compensated clock model by adding passive temperature effects into only the light-sensitive processes in the model. Remarkably, this model was not only capable of full temperature compensation and consistent with mRNA profiles across a temperature range, but also predicted the temperature-dependent change in the level of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, a key clock protein. Our analysis provides a systems-level understanding of period control in the plant circadian oscillator.",

This model is used for optimization of the mutant strain through a rational design approach, and two manipulation targets are identified for overexpression. Dynamic simulations are then performed to compare the curcumin production profiles of the different mutant strains. Our results show that it is possible to obtain a significant improvement in the curcumin production rates with the proposed mutants.

    "synopsis": "The aggregation of proteins is believed to be intimately connected to many neurodegenerative disorders. We recently reported an \"Ockham's razor\"/minimalistic approach to analyze the kinetic data of protein aggregation using the Finke-Watzky (F-W) 2-step model of nucleation (A-->B, rate constant k(1)) and autocatalytic growth (A+B-->2B, rate constant k(2)). With that kinetic model we have analyzed 41 representative protein aggregation data sets in two recent publications, including amyloid beta, alpha-synuclein, polyglutamine, and prion proteins (Morris, A. M., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 2413-2427; Watzky, M. A., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 10790-10800). Herein we use the F-W model to reanalyze protein aggregation kinetic data obtained under the experimental conditions of variable temperature or pH 2.0 to 8.5. We provide the average nucleation (k(1)) and growth (k(2)) rate constants and correlations with variable temperature or varying pH for the protein alpha-synuclein. From the variable temperature data, activation parameters DeltaG(double dagger), DeltaH(double dagger), and DeltaS(double dagger) are provided for nucleation and growth, and those values are compared to the available parameters reported in the previous literature determined using an empirical method. Our activation parameters suggest that nucleation and growth are energetically similar for alpha-synuclein aggregation (DeltaG(double dagger)(nucleation)=23(3) kcal/mol; DeltaG(double dagger)(growth)=22(1) kcal/mol at 37 degrees C). From the variable pH data, the F-W analyses show a maximal k(1) value at pH approximately 3, as well as minimal k(1) near the isoelectric point (pI) of alpha-synuclein. Since solubility and net charge are minimized at the pI, either or both of these factors may be important in determining the kinetics of the nucleation step. On the other hand, the k(2) values increase with decreasing pH (i.e., do not appear to have a minimum or maximum near the pI) which, when combined with the k(1) vs. pH (and pI) data, suggest that solubility and charge are less important factors for growth, and that charge is important in the k(1), nucleation step of alpha-synuclein. The chemically well-defined nucleation (k(1)) rate constants obtained from the F-W analysis are, as expected, different than the 1/lag-time empirical constants previously obtained. However, k(2)x[A](0) (where k(2) is the rate constant for autocatalytic growth and [A](0) is the initial protein concentration) is related to the empirical constant, k(app) obtained previously. Overall, the average nucleation and average growth rate constants for alpha-synuclein aggregation as a function of pH and variable temperature have been quantitated. Those values support the previously suggested formation of a partially folded intermediate that promotes aggregation under high temperature or acidic conditions.",

    "synopsis": "The aggregation of proteins has been hypothesized to be an underlying cause of many neurological disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; protein aggregation is also important to normal life function in cases such as G to F-actin, glutamate dehydrogenase, and tubulin and flagella formation. For this reason, the underlying mechanism of protein aggregation, and accompanying kinetic models for protein nucleation and growth (growth also being called elongation, polymerization, or fibrillation in the literature), have been investigated for more than 50 years. As a way to concisely present the key prior literature in the protein aggregation area, Table 1 in the main text summarizes 23 papers by 10 groups of authors that provide 5 basic classes of mechanisms for protein aggregation over the period from 1959 to 2007. However, and despite this major prior effort, still lacking are both (i) anything approaching a consensus mechanism (or mechanisms), and (ii) a generally useful, and thus widely used, simplest/\"Ockham's razor\" kinetic model and associated equations that can be routinely employed to analyze a broader range of protein aggregation kinetic data. Herein we demonstrate that the 1997 Finke-Watzky (F-W) 2-step mechanism of slow continuous nucleation, A --> B (rate constant k1), followed by typically fast, autocatalytic surface growth, A + B --> 2B (rate constant k2), is able to quantitatively account for the kinetic curves from all 14 representative data sets of neurological protein aggregation found by a literature search (the prion literature was largely excluded for the purposes of this study in order provide some limit to the resultant literature that was covered). The F-W model is able to deconvolute the desired nucleation, k1, and growth, k2, rate constants from those 14 data sets obtained by four different physical methods, for three different proteins, and in nine different labs. The fits are generally good, and in many cases excellent, with R2 values >or=0.98 in all cases. As such, this contribution is the current record of the widest set of protein aggregation data best fit by what is also the simplest model offered to date. Also provided is the mathematical connection between the 1997 F-W 2-step mechanism and the 2000 3-step mechanism proposed by Sait\u00f4 and co-workers. In particular, the kinetic equation for Sait\u00f4's 3-step mechanism is shown to be mathematically identical to the earlier, 1997 2-step F-W mechanism under the 3 simplifying assumptions Sait\u00f4 and co-workers used to derive their kinetic equation. A list of the 3 main caveats/limitations of the F-W kinetic model is provided, followed by the main conclusions from this study as well as some needed future experiments.",

The specific molecular mechanisms ensuring cell division only in response to proliferative signals such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are not fully understood. Here, we combined quantitative time-resolved analysis of primary mouse hepatocyte proliferation at the single cell and at the population level with mathematical modeling. We showed that numerous G1/S transition components are activated upon hepatocyte isolation whereas DNA replication only occurs upon additional HGF stimulation. In response to HGF, Cyclin:CDK complex formation was increased, p21 rather than p27 was regulated, and Rb expression was enhanced. Quantification of protein levels at the restriction point showed an excess of CDK2 over CDK4 and limiting amounts of the transcription factor E2F-1. Analysis with our mathematical model revealed that T160 phosphorylation of CDK2 correlated best with growth factor-dependent proliferation, which we validated experimentally on both the population and the single cell level. In conclusion, we identified CDK2 phosphorylation as a gate-keeping mechanism to maintain hepatocyte quiescence in the absence of HGF.",

Electrophysiological recordings of single channels stimulated with agonists showed that both recombinant and native AMPA receptors visit multiple conductance states in an agonist concentration dependent manner. We propose an allosteric model of the multiple conductance states based on concerted conformational transitions of the four subunits, as an iris diaphragm. Our model predicts that the thermodynamic behaviour of the conductance states upon full and partial agonist stimulations can be described with increased affinity of receptors as they progress to higher conductance states. The model also predicts the existence of AMPA receptors in non-liganded conductive substates. However, the probability of spontaneous openings decreases with increasing conductances. Finally, we predict that the large conductance states are stabilized within the rise phase of a whole-cell EPSC in glutamatergic hippocampal neurons. Our model provides a mechanistic link between ligand concentration and conductance states that can explain thermodynamic and kinetic features of AMPA receptor gating.",

Various hypotheses were tested for the variation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)): (H1) the CMRO(2) remains at its baseline level; (H2) the CMRO(2) is enhanced as soon as the cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases; (H3) the CMRO(2) increase depends on intracellular oxygen and pyruvate concentrations, and intracellular ATP/ADP ratio; (H4) in addition to hypothesis H3, the CMRO(2) progressively increases, due to the action of a second messenger. A good agreement with experimental data from magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS) was obtained when we simulated sustained and repetitive activation protocols using hypotheses (H3) or (H4), rather than hypotheses (H1) or (H2). Furthermore, by studying the effect of the variation of some physiologically important parameters on the time course of the modeled blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we were able to formulate hypotheses about the physiological or biochemical significance of functional magnetic resonance data, especially the poststimulus undershoot and the baseline drift.",

To increase the glucose uptake rate, we propose a rational strategy for designing the molecular architecture of the Escherichia coli glucose PTS by using a computer-aided design (CAD) system and verified the simulated results with biological experiments. CAD supports construction of a biochemical map, mathematical modeling, simulation, and system analysis. Assuming that the PTS aims at controlling the glucose uptake rate, the PTS was decomposed into hierarchical modules, functional and flux modules, and the effect of changes in gene expression on the glucose uptake rate was simulated to make a rational strategy of how the gene regulatory network is engineered. Such design and analysis predicted that the mlc knockout mutant with ptsI gene overexpression would greatly increase the specific glucose uptake rate. By using biological experiments, we validated the prediction and the presented strategy, thereby enhancing the specific glucose uptake rate.",

    "synopsis": "Biomedical research and biotechnological production are greatly benefiting from the results provided by the development of dynamic models of microbial metabolism. Although several kinetic models of Lactococcus lactis (a Lactic Acid Bacterium (LAB) commonly used in the dairy industry) have been developed so far, most of them are simplified and focus only on specific metabolic pathways. Therefore, the application of mathematical models in the design of an engineering strategy for the production of industrially important products by L. lactis has been very limited. In this work, we extend the existing kinetic model of L. lactis central metabolism to include industrially relevant production pathways such as mannitol and 2,3-butanediol. In this way, we expect to study the dynamics of metabolite production and make predictive simulations in L. lactis. We used a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with approximate Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics for each reaction, where the parameters were estimated from multivariate time-series metabolite concentrations obtained by our team through in vivo Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The results show that the model captures observed transient dynamics when validated under a wide range of experimental conditions. Furthermore, we analyzed the model using global perturbations, which corroborate experimental evidence about metabolic responses upon enzymatic changes. These include that mannitol production is very sensitive to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the wild type (W.T.) strain, and to mannitol phosphoenolpyruvate: a phosphotransferase system (PTS(Mtl)) in a LDH mutant strain. LDH reduction has also a positive control on 2,3-butanediol levels. Furthermore, it was found that overproduction of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (MPD) in a LDH/PTS(Mtl) deficient strain can increase the mannitol levels. The results show that this model has prediction capability over new experimental conditions and offers promising possibilities to elucidate the effect of alterations in the main metabolism of L. lactis, with application in strain optimization.",

    "synopsis": "HIV infection leads to two cell fates, the viral productive state or viral latency (a reversible non-productive state). HIV latency is relevant because infected active CD4+ T-lymphocytes can reach a resting memory state in which the provirus remains silent for long periods of time. Despite experimental and theoretical efforts, the causal molecular mechanisms responsible for HIV latency are only partially understood. Studies have determined that HIV latency is influenced by the innate immune response carried out by cell restriction factors that inhibit the postintegration steps in the virus replication cycle. In this study, we present a mathematical study that combines deterministic and stochastic approaches to analyze the interactions between HIV proteins and the innate immune response. Using wide ranges of parameter values, we observed the following: (1) a phenomenological description of the viral productive and latent cell phenotypes is obtained by bistable and bimodal dynamics, (2) biochemical noise reduces the probability that an infected cell adopts the latent state, (3) the effects of the innate immune response enhance the HIV latency state, (4) the conditions of the cell before infection affect the latent phenotype, i.e., the existing expression of cell restriction factors propitiates HIV latency, and existing expression of HIV proteins reduces HIV latency.",

    "title": "Modulation of calmodulin lobes by different targets: an allosteric model with hemiconcerted conformational transitions.",
    "synopsis": "Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells, involved in numerous calcium-regulated biological phenomena, such as synaptic plasticity, muscle contraction, cell cycle, and circadian rhythms. It exibits a characteristic dumbell shape, with two globular domains (N- and C-terminal lobe) joined by a linker region. Each lobe can take alternative conformations, affected by the binding of calcium and target proteins. Calmodulin displays considerable functional flexibility due to its capability to bind different targets, often in a tissue-specific fashion. In various specific physiological environments (e.g. skeletal muscle, neuron dendritic spines) several targets compete for the same calmodulin pool, regulating its availability and affinity for calcium. In this work, we sought to understand the general principles underlying calmodulin modulation by different target proteins, and to account for simultaneous effects of multiple competing targets, thus enabling a more realistic simulation of calmodulin-dependent pathways. We built a mechanistic allosteric model of calmodulin, based on an hemiconcerted framework: each calmodulin lobe can exist in two conformations in thermodynamic equilibrium, with different affinities for calcium and different affinities for each target. Each lobe was allowed to switch conformation on its own. The model was parameterised and validated against experimental data from the literature. In spite of its simplicity, a two-state allosteric model was able to satisfactorily represent several sets of experiments, in particular the binding of calcium on intact and truncated calmodulin and the effect of different skMLCK peptides on calmodulin's saturation curve. The model can also be readily extended to include multiple targets. We show that some targets stabilise the low calcium affinity T state while others stabilise the high affinity R state. Most of the effects produced by calmodulin targets can be explained as modulation of a pre-existing dynamic equilibrium between different conformations of calmodulin's lobes, in agreement with linkage theory and MWC-type models.",

    "synopsis": "This paper presents a detailed systems model of Parkinson's disease (PD), developed utilizing a pragmatic application of biochemical systems theory (BST) intended to assist experimentalists in the study of system behavior. This approach utilizes relative values as a reasonable initial estimate for BST and provides a theoretical means of applying numerical solutions to qualitative and semi-quantitative understandings of cellular pathways and mechanisms. The approach allows for the simulation of human disease through its ability to organize and integrate existing information about metabolic pathways without having a full quantitative description of those pathways, so that hypotheses about individual processes may be tested in a systems environment. Incorporating this method, the PD model describes alpha-synuclein aggregation as mediated by dopamine metabolism, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and lysosomal degradation, allowing for the examination of dynamic pathway interactions and the evaluation of possible toxic mechanisms in the aggregation process. Four system perturbations: elevated alpha-synuclein aggregation, impaired dopamine packaging, increased neurotoxins, and alpha-synuclein overexpression, were analyzed for correlation to qualitative PD system hypotheses present in the literature, with the model demonstrating a high level of agreement with these hypotheses. Additionally, various PD treatment methods, including levadopa and monoamine oxidase inhibition (MAOI) therapy, were applied to the disease models to examine their effects on the system. Future additions and refinements to the model may further the understanding of the emergent behaviors of the disease, helping in the identification of system sensitivities and possible therapeutic targets.",

    "synopsis": "It is an accepted paradigm that extended stress predisposes an individual to pathophysiology. However, the biological adaptations to minimize this risk are poorly understood. Using a computational model based upon realistic kinetic parameters we are able to reproduce the interaction of the stress hormone cortisol with its two nuclear receptors, the high-affinity glucocorticoid receptor and the low-affinity pregnane X-receptor. We demonstrate that regulatory signals between these two nuclear receptors are necessary to optimize the body's response to stress episodes, attenuating both the magnitude and duration of the biological response. In addition, we predict that the activation of pregnane X-receptor by multiple, low-affinity endobiotic ligands is necessary for the significant pregnane X-receptor-mediated transcriptional response observed following stress episodes. This integration allows responses mediated through both the high and low-affinity nuclear receptors, which we predict is an important strategy to minimize the risk of disease from chronic stress.",

    "synopsis": "Recent studies have shown that in addition to the transcriptional circadian clock, many organisms, including Arabidopsis, have a circadian redox rhythm driven by the organism's metabolic activities. It has been hypothesized that the redox rhythm is linked to the circadian clock, but the mechanism and the biological significance of this link have only begun to be investigated. Here we report that the master immune regulator NPR1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1) of Arabidopsis is a sensor of the plant's redox state and regulates transcription of core circadian clock genes even in the absence of pathogen challenge. Surprisingly, acute perturbation in the redox status triggered by the immune signal salicylic acid does not compromise the circadian clock but rather leads to its reinforcement. Mathematical modelling and subsequent experiments show that NPR1 reinforces the circadian clock without changing the period by regulating both the morning and the evening clock genes. This balanced network architecture helps plants gate their immune responses towards the morning and minimize costs on growth at night. Our study demonstrates how a sensitive redox rhythm interacts with a robust circadian clock to ensure proper responsiveness to environmental stimuli without compromising fitness of the organism.",

In this work, we present an adaptation of a previously published, comprehensive model of amphibian phototransduction that can produce quantitatively accurate simulations of the murine photoresponse. We demonstrate the ability of the model to predict responses to a wide range of stimuli and under a variety of mutant conditions.

The backbone of HEPNet consists of primary bio-molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats which ultimately constitute the chief source for the synthesis and obliteration of energy currencies in a cell. A series of biochemical pathways and reactions constituting the catabolism and anabolism of various metabolites are portrayed through cellular compartmentalization. The depicted pathways function synchronously toward an overarching goal of producing ATP and other energy associated moieties to bring into play a variety of cellular functions. HEPNet is manually curated with raw data from experiments and is also connected to KEGG and Reactome databases. This model has been validated by simulating it with physiological states like fasting, starvation, exercise and disease conditions like glycaemia, uremia and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency (DLDD). The results clearly indicate that ATP is the master regulator under different metabolic conditions and physiological states. The results also highlight that energy currencies play a minor role. However, the moiety creatine phosphate has a unique character, since it is a ready-made source of phosphoryl groups for the rapid synthesis of ATP from ADP.

    "synopsis": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase responds to growth factors, nutrients and cellular energy status and is a central controller of cellular growth. mTOR exists in two multiprotein complexes that are embedded into a complex signalling network. Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) is activated by energy deprivation and shuts off adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-consuming anabolic processes, in part via the inactivation of mTORC1. Surprisingly, we observed that AMPK not only responds to energy deprivation but can also be activated by insulin, and is further induced in mTORC1-deficient cells. We have recently modelled the mTOR network, covering both mTOR complexes and their insulin and nutrient inputs. In the present study we extended the network by an AMPK module to generate the to date most comprehensive data-driven dynamic AMPK-mTOR network model. In order to define the intersection via which AMPK is activated by the insulin network, we compared simulations for six different hypothetical model structures to our observed AMPK dynamics. Hypotheses ranking suggested that the most probable intersection between insulin and AMPK was the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and that the effects of canonical IRS downstream cues on AMPK would be mediated via an mTORC1-driven negative-feedback loop. We tested these predictions experimentally in multiple set-ups, where we inhibited or induced players along the insulin-mTORC1 signalling axis and observed AMPK induction or inhibition. We confirmed the identified model and therefore report a novel connection within the insulin-mTOR-AMPK network: we conclude that AMPK is positively regulated by IRS and can be inhibited via the negative-feedback loop.",

    "synopsis": "The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and is a central regulator of growth and metabolism. Insulin activation of mTORC1, mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and the inhibitory tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1-TSC2), initiates a negative feedback loop that ultimately inhibits PI3K. We present a data-driven dynamic insulin-mTOR network model that integrates the entire core network and used this model to investigate the less well understood mechanisms by which insulin regulates mTORC2. By analyzing the effects of perturbations targeting several levels within the network in silico and experimentally, we found that, in contrast to current hypotheses, the TSC1-TSC2 complex was not a direct or indirect (acting through the negative feedback loop) regulator of mTORC2. Although mTORC2 activation required active PI3K, this was not affected by the negative feedback loop. Therefore, we propose an mTORC2 activation pathway through a PI3K variant that is insensitive to the negative feedback loop that regulates mTORC1. This putative pathway predicts that mTORC2 would be refractory to Akt, which inhibits TSC1-TSC2, and, indeed, we found that mTORC2 was insensitive to constitutive Akt activation in several cell types. Our results suggest that a previously unknown network structure connects mTORC2 to its upstream cues and clarifies which molecular connectors contribute to mTORC2 activation.",

    "synopsis": "Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, is thought to help protect an organism from cancer, yet also contributes to ageing. The changes which occur in senescence are controlled by networks of multiple signalling and feedback pathways at the cellular level, and the interplay between these is difficult to predict and understand. To unravel the intrinsic challenges of understanding such a highly networked system, we have taken a systems biology approach to cellular senescence. We report a detailed analysis of senescence signalling via DNA damage, insulin-TOR, FoxO3a transcription factors, oxidative stress response, mitochondrial regulation and mitophagy. We show in silico and in vitro that inhibition of reactive oxygen species can prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, whilst inhibition of mTOR shows a partial rescue of mitochondrial mass changes during establishment of senescence. Dual inhibition of ROS and mTOR in vitro confirmed computational model predictions that it was possible to further reduce senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA double-strand breaks. However, these interventions were unable to abrogate the senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction completely, and we identified decreased mitochondrial fission as the potential driving force for increased mitochondrial mass via prevention of mitophagy. Dynamic sensitivity analysis of the model showed the network stabilised at a new late state of cellular senescence. This was characterised by poor network sensitivity, high signalling noise, low cellular energy, high inflammation and permanent cell cycle arrest suggesting an unsatisfactory outcome for treatments aiming to delay or reverse cellular senescence at late time points. Combinatorial targeted interventions are therefore possible for intervening in the cellular pathway to senescence, but in the cases identified here, are only capable of delaying senescence onset.",

    "synopsis": "Clostridium difficile infections are associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and result in an exuberant inflammatory response, leading to nosocomial diarrhea, colitis and even death. To better understand the dynamics of mucosal immunity during C. difficile infection from initiation through expansion to resolution, we built a computational model of the mucosal immune response to the bacterium. The model was calibrated using data from a mouse model of C. difficile infection. The model demonstrates a crucial role of T helper 17 (Th17) effector responses in the colonic lamina propria and luminal commensal bacteria populations in the clearance of C. difficile and colonic pathology, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells responses are associated with the recovery phase. In addition, the production of anti-microbial peptides by inflamed epithelial cells and activated neutrophils in response to C. difficile infection inhibit the re-growth of beneficial commensal bacterial species. Computational simulations suggest that the removal of neutrophil and epithelial cell derived anti-microbial inhibitions, separately and together, on commensal bacterial regrowth promote recovery and minimize colonic inflammatory pathology. Simulation results predict a decrease in colonic inflammatory markers, such as neutrophilic influx and Th17 cells in the colonic lamina propria, and length of infection with accelerated commensal bacteria re-growth through altered anti-microbial inhibition. Computational modeling provides novel insights on the therapeutic value of repopulating the colonic microbiome and inducing regulatory mucosal immune responses during C. difficile infection. Thus, modeling mucosal immunity-gut microbiota interactions has the potential to guide the development of targeted fecal transplantation therapies in the context of precision medicine interventions.",

The case study, presented here, investigates interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) induced STAT1 signalling in two cell types that play a key role in pancreatic cancer development: pancreatic stellate and cancer cells. IFN\u03b3 inhibits the growth for both types of cells and may be prototypic of agents that simultaneously hit cancer and stroma cells. We combined time-course experiments with mathematical modelling to focus on the common situation in which variations between profiles of experimental time series, from different cell types, are observed. To understand how biochemical reactions are causing the observed variations, we performed a parameter identifiability analysis. We successfully identified reactions that differ in pancreatic stellate cells and cancer cells, by comparing confidence intervals of parameter value estimates and the variability of model trajectories. Our analysis shows that useful information can also be obtained from nonidentifiable parameters. For the prediction of potential therapeutic targets we studied the consequences of uncertainty in the values of identifiable and nonidentifiable parameters. Interestingly, the sensitivity of model variables is robust against parameter variations and against differences between IFN\u03b3 induced STAT1 signalling in pancreatic stellate and cancer cells. This provides the basis for a prediction of therapeutic targets that are valid for both cell types.",

However, selecting targets from this pathway either by intuition or by non-contextual measures is likely to be challenging. An alternative approach is to construct a mathematical model of the system and via sensitivity analysis rank order the targets in the known pathway, with respect to an endpoint such as the diphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase concentration in the nucleus. Using the published literature, a model was created and, via sensitivity analysis, it was concluded that, after NGF itself, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) was one of the most sensitive druggable targets. This initial model was subsequently used to develop a further model incorporating physiological and pharmacological parameters. This allowed the exploration of the characteristics required for a successful hypothetical TrkA inhibitor. Using these systems models, we were able to identify candidates for the optimal drug targets in the known pathway. These conclusions were consistent with clinical and human genetic data. We also found that incorporating appropriate physiological context was essential to drawing accurate conclusions about important parameters such as the drug dose required to give pathway inhibition. Furthermore, the importance of the concentration of key reactants such as TrkA kinase means that appropriate contextual data are required before clear conclusions can be drawn. Such models could be of great utility in selecting optimal targets and in the clinical evaluation of novel drugs.",

    "synopsis": "Light/dark cycles are probably the most important environmental signals that regulate plant development. Light is essential for photosynthesis, but an excess, in combination with the unavoidable presence of atmospheric oxygen inside the chloroplast, leads to excessive reactive oxygen species production. Among the defense mechanisms that activate plants to cope with environmental stress situations, it is worth noting the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, a complex metabolic pathway in which a variety of photochemical, chemical and enzymatic steps are involved.We herein studied the dynamic behavior of this pathway under light/dark conditions and for several consecutive days. For this purpose, a mathematical model was developed including a variable electron source with a rate law proportional to the intensity of solar irradiance during the photoperiod, and which is continuously turned off at night and on again the next day. The model is defined by a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with an on/off time-dependent input, including a parameter to simulate the fact that the photoperiod length is not constant throughout the year, and which takes into account the particular experimental kinetics of each enzyme involved in the pathway. Unlike previous models, which have only provided steady-state solutions, the present model is able to simulate diurnal fluctuations in the metabolite concentrations, fluxes and enzymatic rates involved in the network.The obtained results are broadly consistent with experimental observations and highlight the key role played by ascorbate recycling for plants to adapt to their surrounding environment. This approach provides a new strategy to in vivo studies to analyze plant defense mechanisms against oxidative stress induced by external changes, which can also be extrapolated to other complex metabolic pathways to constitute a useful tool to the scientific community in general.",

    "synopsis": "Selection on proteins is typically measured with the assumption that each protein acts independently. However, selection more likely acts at higher levels of biological organization, requiring an integrative view of protein function. Here, we built a kinetic model for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to relate pathway function to selective pressures on individual protein-encoding genes.Gene families across yeast were constructed for each member of the pathway and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS) was estimated for each enzyme from S. cerevisiae and closely related species. We found a positive relationship between the influence that each enzyme has on pathway function and its selective constraint.We expect this trend to be locally present for enzymes that have pathway control, but over longer evolutionary timescales we expect that mutation-selection balance may change the enzymes that have pathway control.",

    "synopsis": "STAT5A and STAT5B are important transcription factors that dimerize and transduce activation signals of cytokine receptors directly to the nucleus. A typical cytokine that mediates STAT5 activation is erythropoietin (Epo). Differential functions of STAT5A and STAT5B have been reported. However, the extent to which phosphorylated STAT5A and STAT5B (pSTAT5A, pSTAT5B) form homo- or heterodimers is not understood, nor is how this might influence the signal transmission to the nucleus. To study this, we designed a concept to investigate the isoform-specific dimerization behavior of pSTAT5A and pSTAT5B that comprises isoform-specific immunoprecipitation (IP), measurement of the degree of phosphorylation, and isoform ratio determination between STAT5A and STAT5B. For the main analytical method, we employed quantitative label-free and -based mass spectrometry. For the cellular model system, we used Epo receptor (EpoR)-expressing BaF3 cells (BaF3-EpoR) stimulated with Epo. Three hypotheses of dimer formation between pSTAT5A and pSTAT5B were used to explain the analytical results by a static mathematical model: formation of (i) homodimers only, (ii) heterodimers only, and (iii) random formation of homo- and heterodimers. The best agreement between experimental data and model simulations was found for the last case. Dynamics of cytoplasmic STAT5 dimerization could be explained by distinct nuclear import rates and individual nuclear retention for homo- and heterodimers of phosphorylated STAT5.",

    "title": "Modeling the Regulatory Mechanisms by Which NLRX1 Modulates Innate Immune Responses to Helicobacter pylori Infection.",
    "synopsis": "Helicobacter pylori colonizes half of the world's population as the dominant member of the gastric microbiota resulting in a lifelong chronic infection. Host responses toward the bacterium can result in asymptomatic, pathogenic or even favorable health outcomes; however, mechanisms underlying the dual role of H. pylori as a commensal versus pathogenic organism are not well characterized. Recent evidence suggests mononuclear phagocytes are largely involved in shaping dominant immunity during infection mediating the balance between host tolerance and succumbing to overt disease. We combined computational modeling, bioinformatics and experimental validation in order to investigate interactions between macrophages and intracellular H. pylori. Global transcriptomic analysis on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in a gentamycin protection assay at six time points unveiled the presence of three sequential host response waves: an early transient regulatory gene module followed by sustained and late effector responses. Kinetic behaviors of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are linked to differential expression of spatiotemporal response waves and function to induce effector immunity through extracellular and intracellular detection of H. pylori. We report that bacterial interaction with the host intracellular environment caused significant suppression of regulatory NLRC3 and NLRX1 in a pattern inverse to early regulatory responses. To further delineate complex immune responses and pathway crosstalk between effector and regulatory PRRs, we built a computational model calibrated using time-series RNAseq data. Our validated computational hypotheses are that: 1) NLRX1 expression regulates bacterial burden in macrophages; and 2) early host response cytokines down-regulate NLRX1 expression through a negative feedback circuit. This paper applies modeling approaches to characterize the regulatory role of NLRX1 in mechanisms of host tolerance employed by macrophages to respond to and/or to co-exist with intracellular H. pylori.",

    "synopsis": "Chemokine CXCL12 promotes growth and metastasis of more than 20 different human cancers, as well as pathogenesis of other common diseases. CXCL12 binds two different receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, both of which recruit and signal through the cytosolic adapter protein \u03b2-arrestin 2. Differences in CXCL12-dependent recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin 2 in cells expressing one or both receptors remain poorly defined. To quantitatively investigate parameters controlling association of \u03b2-arrestin 2 with CXCR4 or CXCR7 in cells co-expressing both receptors, we used a systems biology approach combining real-time, multi-spectral luciferase complementation imaging with computational modeling. Cells expressing only CXCR4 maintain low basal association with \u03b2-arrestin 2, and CXCL12 induces a rapid, transient increase in this interaction. In contrast, cells expressing only CXCR7 have higher basal association with \u03b2-arrestin 2 and exhibit more gradual, prolonged recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin 2 in response to CXCL12. We developed and fit a data-driven computational model for association of either CXCR4 or CXCR7 with \u03b2-arrestin 2 in cells expressing only one type of receptor. We then experimentally validated model predictions that co-expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 on the same cell substantially decreases both the magnitude and duration of CXCL12-regulated recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin 2 to CXCR4. Co-expression of both receptors on the same cell only minimally alters recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin 2 to CXCR7. In silico experiments also identified \u03b2-arrestin 2 as a limiting factor in cells expressing both receptors, establishing that CXCR7 wins the \"competition\" with CXCR4 for CXCL12 and recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin 2. These results reveal how competition for \u03b2-arrestin 2 controls integrated responses to CXCL12 in cells expressing both CXCR4 and CXCR7. These results advance understanding of normal and pathologic functions of CXCL12, which is critical for developing effective strategies to target these pathways therapeutically.",

    "title": "Plasticity of TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: The family of TGF-\u03b2 ligands is large and its members are involved in many different signaling processes. These signaling processes strongly differ in type with TGF-\u03b2 ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members of the TGF-\u03b2 family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then be expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand concentration. A number of different models have been proposed to reconcile these different behaviours. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications that are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling network. RESULTS: To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the core of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give rise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as well as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to time-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens). A combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus biases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while oscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the turn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient receptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding. We find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the response type. The intensity of a constant signal (i.e. the ligand concentration), on the other hand, affected only the strength but not the type of the response. CONCLUSIONS: The architecture of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway enables the observed signaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGF-\u03b2 ligand in different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways. It will be interesting to uncover the exact cellular differences as well as the details of the cross-talks in future work.",

    "synopsis": "The process of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) comprises 4 phases in smooth muscle cells. Phase 1 is characterized by a large increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with a minimal reduction of the free luminal SR [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]FSR). Importantly, active SR Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA pumps) are necessary for phase 1 to occur. This situation cannot be explained by the standard kinetics that involves a fixed amount of luminal Ca2+ binding sites. A new mathematical model was developed that assumes an increasing SR Ca2+ buffering capacity in response to an increase of the luminal SR [Ca2+] that is called Kinetics-on-Demand (KonD) model. This approach can explain both phase 1 and the refractory period associated with a recovered [Ca2+]FSR. Additionally, our data suggest that active SERCA pumps are a requisite for KonD to be functional; otherwise luminal SR Ca2+ binding proteins switch to standard kinetics. The importance of KonD Ca2+ binding properties is twofold: a more efficient Ca2+ release process and that [Ca2+]FSR and Ca2+-bound to SR proteins ([Ca2+]BSR) can be regulated separately allowing for Ca2+ release to occur (provided by Ca2+-bound to luminal Ca2+ binding proteins) without an initial reduction of the [Ca2+]FSR.",

    "synopsis": "Tryptophan is utilized in various metabolic routes including protein synthesis, serotonin, and melatonin synthesis and the kynurenine pathway. Perturbations in these pathways have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here we present a comprehensive kinetic model of the complex network of human tryptophan metabolism based upon existing kinetic data for all enzymatic conversions and transporters. By integrating tissue-specific expression data, modeling tryptophan metabolism in liver and brain returned intermediate metabolite concentrations in the physiological range. Sensitivity and metabolic control analyses identified expected key enzymes to govern fluxes in the branches of the network. Combining tissue-specific models revealed a considerable impact of the kynurenine pathway in liver on the concentrations of neuroactive derivatives in the brain. Moreover, using expression data from a cancer study predicted metabolite changes that resembled the experimental observations. We conclude that the combination of the kinetic model with expression data represents a powerful diagnostic tool to predict alterations in tryptophan metabolism. The model is readily scalable to include more tissues, thereby enabling assessment of organismal tryptophan metabolism in health and disease.",

    "title": "The development of a fully-integrated immune response model (FIRM) simulator of the immune response through integration of multiple subset models.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: The complexity and multiscale nature of the mammalian immune response provides an excellent test bed for the potential of mathematical modeling and simulation to facilitate mechanistic understanding. Historically, mathematical models of the immune response focused on subsets of the immune system and/or specific aspects of the response. Mathematical models have been developed for the humoral side of the immune response, or for the cellular side, or for cytokine kinetics, but rarely have they been proposed to encompass the overall system complexity. We propose here a framework for integration of subset models, based on a system biology approach. RESULTS: A dynamic simulator, the Fully-integrated Immune Response Model (FIRM), was built in a stepwise fashion by integrating published subset models and adding novel features. The approach used to build the model includes the formulation of the network of interacting species and the subsequent introduction of rate laws to describe each biological process. The resulting model represents a multi-organ structure, comprised of the target organ where the immune response takes place, circulating blood, lymphoid T, and lymphoid B tissue. The cell types accounted for include macrophages, a few T-cell lineages (cytotoxic, regulatory, helper 1, and helper 2), and B-cell activation to plasma cells. Four different cytokines were accounted for: IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12. In addition, generic inflammatory signals are used to represent the kinetics of IL-1, IL-2, and TGF-\u03b2. Cell recruitment, differentiation, replication, apoptosis and migration are described as appropriate for the different cell types. The model is a hybrid structure containing information from several mammalian species. The structure of the network was built to be physiologically and biochemically consistent. Rate laws for all the cellular fate processes, growth factor production rates and half-lives, together with antibody production rates and half-lives, are provided. The results demonstrate how this framework can be used to integrate mathematical models of the immune response from several published sources and describe qualitative predictions of global immune system response arising from the integrated, hybrid model. In addition, we show how the model can be expanded to include novel biological findings. Case studies were carried out to simulate TB infection, tumor rejection, response to a blood borne pathogen and the consequences of accounting for regulatory T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: The final result of this work is a postulated and increasingly comprehensive representation of the mammalian immune system, based on physiological knowledge and susceptible to further experimental testing and validation. We believe that the integrated nature of FIRM has the potential to simulate a range of responses under a variety of conditions, from modeling of immune responses after tuberculosis (TB) infection to tumor formation in tissues. FIRM also has the flexibility to be expanded to include both complex and novel immunological response features as our knowledge of the immune system advances.",

Current models of acetaminophen metabolism are complex, and limited to numerical investigation though provide results that represent clinical investigation well. We derive a mathematical model based on mass action laws aimed at capturing the main dynamics of acetaminophen metabolism, in particular the contrast between normal and overdose cases, whilst remaining simple enough for detailed mathematical analysis that can identify key parameters and quantify their role in liver toxicity. We use singular perturbation analysis to separate the different timescales describing the sequence of events in acetaminophen metabolism, systematically identifying which parameters dominate during each of the successive stages. Using this approach we determined, in terms of the model parameters, the critical dose between safe and overdose cases, timescales for exhaustion and regeneration of important cofactors for acetaminophen metabolism and total toxin accumulation as a fraction of initial dose.",

Sensitivity analysis applied to the model revealed that lag time, peak thrombin concentration, area under the curve (AUC) of the thrombin generation profile, and aPTT show different sensitivity to changes in coagulation factors' concentrations and type of plasma used (normal or factor VIII-deficient).

    "synopsis": "Bone remodeling is the continuous process of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, in order to maintain homeostasis. The activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts is regulated by a network of signaling pathways, including Wnt, parathyroid hormone (PTH), RANK ligand/osteoprotegrin, and TGF-\u03b2, in response to stimuli, such as mechanical loading. During aging there is a gradual loss of bone mass due to dysregulation of signaling pathways. This may be due to a decline in physical activity with age and/or changes in hormones and other signaling molecules. In particular, hormones, such as PTH, have a circadian rhythm, which may be disrupted in aging. Due to the complexity of the molecular and cellular networks involved in bone remodeling, several mathematical models have been proposed to aid understanding of the processes involved. However, to date, there are no models, which explicitly consider the effects of mechanical loading, the circadian rhythm of PTH, and the dynamics of signaling molecules on bone remodeling. Therefore, we have constructed a network model of the system using a modular approach, which will allow further modifications as required in future research. The model was used to simulate the effects of mechanical loading and also the effects of different interventions, such as continuous or intermittent administration of PTH. Our model predicts that the absence of regular mechanical loading and/or an impaired PTH circadian rhythm leads to a gradual decrease in bone mass over time, which can be restored by simulated interventions and that the effectiveness of some interventions may depend on their timing.",

The literature provides a wealth of qualitative and/or quantitative descriptions of cellular mechanisms, bone dynamics, associated organ dynamics, related disease sequela, and results of therapeutic interventions. We present a physiologically based mathematical model of integrated calcium homeostasis and bone biology constructed from literature data. The model includes relevant cellular aspects with major controlling mechanisms for bone remodeling and calcium homeostasis and appropriately describes a broad range of clinical and therapeutic conditions. These include changes in plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, calcium and phosphate (PO4), and bone-remodeling markers as manifested by hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, renal insufficiency, daily PTH 1-34 administration, and receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) inhibition. This model highlights the utility of systems approaches to physiologic modeling in the bone field. The presented bone and calcium homeostasis model provides an integrated mathematical construct to conduct hypothesis testing of influential system aspects, to visualize elements of this complex endocrine system, and to continue to build upon iteratively with the results of ongoing scientific research.",

    "synopsis": "Conformational transitions of human calcitonin (hCT) during fibril formation in the acidic and neutral conditions were investigated by high-resolution solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy. In aqueous acetic acid solution (pH 3.3), a local alpha-helical form is present around Gly10 whereas a random coil form is dominant as viewed from Phe22, Ala26, and Ala31 in the monomer form on the basis of the 13C chemical shifts. On the other hand, a local beta-sheet form as viewed from Gly10 and Phe22, and both beta-sheet and random coil as viewed from Ala26 and Ala31 were detected in the fibril at pH 3.3. The results indicate that conformational transitions from alpha-helix to beta-sheet, and from random coil to beta-sheet forms occurred in the central and C-terminus regions, respectively, during the fibril formation. The increased 13C resonance intensities of fibrils after a certain delay time suggests that the fibrillation can be explained by a two-step reaction mechanism in which the first step is a homogeneous association to form a nucleus, and the second step is an autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation. In contrast to the fibril at pH 3.3, the fibril at pH 7.5 formed a local beta-sheet conformation at the central region and exhibited a random coil at the C-terminus region. Not only a hydrophobic interaction among the amphiphilic alpha-helices, but also an electrostatic interaction between charged side chains can play an important role for the fibril formation at pH 7.5 and 3.3 acting as electrostatically favorable and unfavorable interactions, respectively. These results suggest that hCT fibrils are formed by stacking antiparallel beta-sheets at pH 7.5 and a mixture of antiparallel and parallel beta-sheets at pH 3.3.",

The model accounts for \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) production in the soma, transport toward the synapse, misfolding, and aggregation. The production and aggregation of polymeric \u03b1-syn is simulated using a minimalistic 2-step Finke-Watzky model. We utilized the developed model to analyze what changes in a healthy neuron are likely to lead to the onset of \u03b1-syn aggregation. We checked the effects of interruption of \u03b1-syn transport toward the synapse, entry of misfolded (infectious) \u03b1-syn into the somatic and synaptic compartments, increasing the rate of \u03b1-syn synthesis in the soma, and failure of \u03b1-syn degradation machinery. Our model suggests that failure of \u03b1-syn degradation machinery is probably the most likely cause for the onset of \u03b1-syn aggregation leading to PD.",

    "synopsis": "There is growing interest in inflammation due to its involvement in many diverse medical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, arthritis and asthma. The traditional view that resolution of inflammation is a passive process is now being superceded by an alternative hypothesis whereby its resolution is an active, anti-inflammatory process that can be manipulated therapeutically. This shift in mindset has stimulated a resurgence of interest in the biological mechanisms by which inflammation resolves. The anti-inflammatory processes central to the resolution of inflammation revolve around macrophages and are closely related to pro-inflammatory processes mediated by neutrophils and their ability to damage healthy tissue. We develop a spatially averaged model of inflammation centring on its resolution, accounting for populations of neutrophils and macrophages and incorporating both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Our ordinary differential equation model exhibits two outcomes that we relate to healthy and unhealthy states. We use bifurcation analysis to investigate how variation in the system parameters affects its outcome. We find that therapeutic manipulation of the rate of macrophage phagocytosis can aid in resolving inflammation but success is critically dependent on the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. Indeed our model predicts that an effective treatment protocol would take a dual approach, targeting macrophage phagocytosis alongside neutrophil apoptosis.",

    "synopsis": "Reproducibility of biological data is a significant problem in research today. One potential contributor to this, which has received little attention, is the over complication of enzyme kinetic inhibition models. The over complication of inhibitory models stems from the common use of the inhibitory term (1 + [I]/Ki ), an equilibrium binding term that does not distinguish between inhibitor binding and inhibitory effect. Since its initial appearance in the literature, around a century ago, the perceived mechanistic methods used in its production have spurred countless inhibitory equations. These equations are overly complex and are seldom compared to each other, which has destroyed their usefulness resulting in the proliferation and regulatory acceptance of simpler models such as IC50s for drug characterization. However, empirical analysis of inhibitory data recognizing the clear distinctions between inhibitor binding and inhibitory effect can produce simple logical inhibition models. In contrast to the common divergent practice of generating new inhibitory models for every inhibitory situation that presents itself. The empirical approach to inhibition modeling presented here is broadly applicable allowing easy comparison and rational analysis of drug interactions. To demonstrate this, a simple kinetic model of DAPT, a compound that both activates and inhibits \u03b3-secretase is examined using excel. The empirical kinetic method described here provides an improved way of probing disease mechanisms, expanding the investigation of possible therapeutic interventions.",

A\u03b2 clearance via the blood-brain barrier is reduced by approximately 30% in AD patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. ABC transporters have been implicated in the regulation of A\u03b2 levels in the brain. Using a mouse model of AD in which the animals were further genetically modified to lack specific ABC transporters, here we have shown that the transporter ABCC1 has an important role in cerebral A\u03b2 clearance and accumulation. Deficiency of ABCC1 substantially increased cerebral A\u03b2 levels without altering the expression of most enzymes that would favor the production of A\u03b2 from the A\u03b2 precursor protein. In contrast, activation of ABCC1 using thiethylperazine (a drug approved by the FDA to relieve nausea and vomiting) markedly reduced A\u03b2 load in a mouse model of AD expressing ABCC1 but not in such mice lacking ABCC1. Thus, by altering the temporal aggregation profile of A\u03b2, pharmacological activation of ABC transporters could impede the neurodegenerative cascade that culminates in the dementia of AD.",

Following ubiquitination by external ligases, Ring1B is targeted for proteosomal degradation. Using biochemical data and computational modeling, we show that the Ring1B ligase can exhibit abrupt switches, overshoot transitions and self-perpetuating oscillations between its distinct ubiquitination and activity states. These different Ring1B states display canonical or multiply branched, atypical polyubiquitin chains and involve association with the Polycomb-group protein Bmi1. Bistable switches and oscillations may lead to all-or-none histone H2A monoubiquitination rates and result in discrete periods of gene (in)activity. Switches, overshoots and oscillations in Ring1B catalytic activity and proteosomal degradation are controlled by the abundances of Bmi1 and Ring1B, and the activities and abundances of external ligases and deubiquitinases, such as E6-AP and USP7.",

    "synopsis": "The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activated Extracellular-signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway is a critical cell signalling pathway that relays the signal for a cell to proliferate from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Deregulation of the EGFR/ERK pathway due to alterations affecting the expression or function of a number of pathway components has long been associated with numerous forms of cancer. Under normal conditions, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulates a rapid but transient activation of ERK as the signal is rapidly shutdown. Whereas, under cancerous mutation conditions the ERK signal cannot be shutdown and is sustained resulting in the constitutive activation of ERK and continual cell proliferation. In this study, we have used computational modelling techniques to investigate what effects various cancerous alterations have on the signalling flow through the ERK pathway.We have generated a new model of the EGFR activated ERK pathway, which was verified by our own experimental data. We then altered our model to represent various cancerous situations such as Ras, B-Raf and EGFR mutations, as well as EGFR overexpression. Analysis of the models showed that different cancerous situations resulted in different signalling patterns through the ERK pathway, especially when compared to the normal EGF signal pattern. Our model predicts that cancerous EGFR mutation and overexpression signals almost exclusively via the Rap1 pathway, predicting that this pathway is the best target for drugs. Furthermore, our model also highlights the importance of receptor degradation in normal and cancerous EGFR signalling, and suggests that receptor degradation is a key difference between the signalling from the EGF and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) receptors.Our results suggest that different routes to ERK activation are being utilised in different cancerous situations which therefore has interesting implications for drug selection strategies. We also conducted a comparison of the critical differences between signalling from different growth factor receptors (namely EGFR, mutated EGFR, NGF, and Insulin) with our results suggesting the difference between the systems are large scale and can be attributed to the presence/absence of entire pathways rather than subtle difference in individual rate constants between the systems.",

    "synopsis": "T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a highly plastic subset of CD4+ T cells specialized in providing B cell help and promoting inflammatory and effector responses during infectious and immune-mediate diseases. Helicobacter pylori is the dominant member of the gastric microbiota and exerts both beneficial and harmful effects on the host. Chronic inflammation in the context of H. pylori has been linked to an upregulation in T helper (Th)1 and Th17 CD4+ T cell phenotypes, controlled in part by the cytokine, interleukin-21. This study investigates the differentiation and regulation of Tfh cells, major producers of IL-21, in the immune response to H. pylori challenge. To better understand the conditions influencing the promotion and inhibition of a chronically elevated Tfh population, we used top-down and bottom-up approaches to develop computational models of Tfh and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell differentiation. Stability analysis was used to characterize the presence of two bi-stable steady states in the calibrated Tfh/Tfr models. Stochastic simulation was used to illustrate the ability of the parameter set to dictate two distinct behavioral patterns. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis helped identify the importance of various parameters on the establishment of Tfh and Tfr cell populations. The core network model was expanded into a more comprehensive and predictive model by including cytokine production and signaling pathways. From the expanded network, the interaction between TGFB-Induced Factor Homeobox 1 (Tgif1) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) was displayed to exert control over the determination of the Tfh response. Model simulations predict that Tgif1 and RXR respectively induce and curtail Tfh responses. This computational hypothesis was validated experimentally by assaying Tgif1, RXR and Tfh in stomachs of mice infected with H. pylori.",

    "title": "Dynamic modeling of yeast meiotic initiation.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Meiosis is the sexual reproduction process common to eukaryotes. The diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes meiosis in sporulation medium to form four haploid spores. Initiation of the process is tightly controlled by intricate networks of positive and negative feedback loops. Intriguingly, expression of early meiotic proteins occurs within a narrow time window. Further, sporulation efficiency is strikingly different for yeast strains with distinct mutations or genetic backgrounds. To investigate signal transduction pathways that regulate transient protein expression and sporulation efficiency, we develop a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations. The model describes early meiotic events, particularly feedback mechanisms at the system level and phosphorylation of signaling molecules for regulating protein activities. RESULTS: The mathematical model is capable of simulating the orderly and transient dynamics of meiotic proteins including Ime1, the master regulator of meiotic initiation, and Ime2, a kinase encoded by an early gene. The model is validated by quantitative sporulation phenotypes of single-gene knockouts. Thus, we can use the model to make novel predictions on the cooperation between proteins in the signaling pathway. Virtual perturbations on feedback loops suggest that both positive and negative feedback loops are required to terminate expression of early meiotic proteins. Bifurcation analyses on feedback loops indicate that multiple feedback loops are coordinated to modulate sporulation efficiency. In particular, positive auto-regulation of Ime2 produces a bistable system with a normal meiotic state and a more efficient meiotic state. CONCLUSIONS: By systematically scanning through feedback loops in the mathematical model, we demonstrate that, in yeast, the decisions to terminate protein expression and to sporulate at different efficiencies stem from feedback signals toward the master regulator Ime1 and the early meiotic protein Ime2. We argue that the architecture of meiotic initiation pathway generates a robust mechanism that assures a rapid and complete transition into meiosis. This type of systems-level regulation is a commonly used mechanism controlling developmental programs in yeast and other organisms. Our mathematical model uncovers key regulations that can be manipulated to enhance sporulation efficiency, an important first step in the development of new strategies for producing gametes with high quality and quantity.",

    "synopsis": "Blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) is a standard clinical tool for the detection of brain activation. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), task-related and resting state fMRI have been used to detect brain dysfunction. It has been shown that the shape of the BOLD response is affected in early AD. To correctly interpret these changes, the mechanisms responsible for the observed behaviour need to be known. The parameters of the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) commonly used in the analysis of fMRI data have no direct biological interpretation and cannot be used to answer this question. We here present a model that allows relating AD-specific changes in the BOLD shape to changes in the underlying energy metabolism. According to our findings, the classic view that differences in the BOLD shape are only attributed to changes in strength and duration of the stimulus does not hold. Instead, peak height, peak timing and full width at half maximum are sensitive to changes in the reaction rate of several metabolic reactions. Our systems-theoretic approach allows the use of patient-specific clinical data to predict dementia-driven changes in the HRF, which can be used to improve the results of fMRI analyses in AD patients.",

    "synopsis": "NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two prominent forms of synaptic plasticity, both of which are triggered by post-synaptic calcium elevation. To understand how calcium selectively stimulates two opposing processes, we developed a detailed computational model and performed simulations with different calcium input frequencies, amplitudes, and durations. We show that with a total amount of calcium ions kept constant, high frequencies of calcium pulses stimulate calmodulin more efficiently. Calcium input activates both calcineurin and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at all frequencies, but increased frequencies shift the relative activation from calcineurin to CaMKII. Irrespective of amplitude and duration of the inputs, the total amount of calcium ions injected adjusts the sensitivity of the system to calcium input frequencies. At a given frequency, the quantity of CaMKII activated is proportional to the total amount of calcium. Thus, an input of a small amount of calcium at high frequencies can induce the same activation of CaMKII as a larger amount, at lower frequencies. Finally, the extent of activation of CaMKII signals with high calcium frequency is further controlled by other factors, including the availability of calmodulin, and by the potency of phosphatase inhibitors.",

    "synopsis": "All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and its synthetic analogues EC23 and EC19 direct cellular differentiation by interacting as ligands for the retinoic acid receptor (RAR\u00ce\u00b1, \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b3) family of nuclear receptor proteins. To date, a number of crystal structures of natural and synthetic ligands complexed to their target proteins have been solved, providing molecular level snap-shots of ligand binding. However, a deeper understanding of\nreceptor and ligand flexibility and conformational freedom is required to develop stable and effective ATRA analogues for clinical use. Therefore, we have used molecular modelling techniques to define RAR interactions with ATRA and two synthetic analogues, EC19 and EC23, and compared their predicted biochemical\nactivities to experimental measurements of relative ligand affinity and recruitment of coactivator proteins. A comprehensive molecular docking approach that explored the conformational space of the ligands indicated that ATRA is able to bind the three RAR proteins in a number of conformations with one extended\nstructure being favoured. In contrast the biologically-distinct isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA), showed\nsignificantly less conformational flexibility in the RAR binding pockets. These findings were used to inform\ndocking studies of the synthetic retinoids EC23 and EC19, and their respective methyl esters. EC23 was\nfound to be an excellent mimic for ATRA, and occupied similar binding modes to ATRA in all three target\nRAR proteins. In comparison, EC19 exhibited an alternative binding mode which reduces the strength of\nkey polar interactions in RAR\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b3 but is well-suited to the larger RAR\u00ce\u00b2 binding pocket. In contrast, docking of the corresponding esters revealed the loss of key polar interactions which may explain the much reduced biological activity. Our computational results were complemented using an in vitro binding assay\nbased on FRET measurements, which showed that EC23 was a strongly binding, pan-agonist of the RARs,\nwhile EC19 exhibited specificity for RAR\u00ce\u00b2, as predicted by the docking studies. These findings can account for the distinct behaviour of EC23 and EC19 in cellular differentiation assays, and additionally, the methods described herein can be further applied to the understanding of the molecular basis for the selectivity of different retinoids to RAR\u00ce\u00b1, \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b3.",

    "synopsis": "Plasmin (PLS) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPA) are ubiquitous proteases that regulate the extracellular environment. Although they are secreted in inactive forms, they can activate each other through proteolytic cleavage. This mutual interplay creates the potential for complex dynamics, which we investigated using mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments. We constructed ordinary differential equations to model the conversion of precursor plasminogen into active PLS, and precursor urokinase (scUPA) into active urokinase (tcUPA). Although neither PLS nor UPA exhibits allosteric cooperativity, modeling showed that cooperativity occurred at the system level because of substrate competition. Computational simulations and bifurcation analysis predicted that the system would be bistable over a range of parameters for cooperativity and positive feedback. Cell-free experiments with recombinant proteins tested key predictions of the model. PLS activation in response to scUPA stimulus was found to be cooperative in vitro. Finally, bistability was demonstrated in vitro by the presence of two significantly different steady-state levels of PLS activation for the same levels of stimulus. We conclude that ultrasensitive, bistable activation of UPA-PLS is possible in the presence of substrate competition. An ultrasensitive threshold for activation of PLS and UPA would have ramifications for normal and disease processes, including angiogenesis, metastasis, wound healing, and fibrosis.",

    "synopsis": "The circadian clock is an endogenous timekeeper that allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to the daily variations of their environment. The plant clock is an intricate network of interlocked feedback loops, in which transcription factors regulate each other to generate oscillations with expression peaks at specific times of the day. Over the last decade, mathematical modeling approaches have been used to understand the inner workings of the clock in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Those efforts have produced a number of models of ever increasing complexity. Here, we present an alternative model that combines a low number of equations and parameters, similar to the very earliest models, with the complex network structure found in more recent ones. This simple model describes the temporal evolution of the abundance of eight clock gene mRNA/protein and captures key features of the clock on a qualitative level, namely the entrained and free-running behaviors of the wild type clock, as well as the defects found in knockout mutants (such as altered free-running periods, lack of entrainment, or changes in the expression of other clock genes). Additionally, our model produces complex responses to various light cues, such as extreme photoperiods and non-24 h environmental cycles, and can describe the control of hypocotyl growth by the clock. Our model constitutes a useful tool to probe dynamical properties of the core clock as well as clock-dependent processes.",

    "synopsis": "Excessive DNA damage can induce an irreversible cell cycle arrest, called senescence, which is generally perceived as an important tumour-suppressor mechanism. However, it is unclear how cells decide whether to senesce or not after DNA damage. By combining experimental data with a parameterized mathematical model we elucidate this cell fate decision at the G1-S transition. Our model provides a quantitative and conceptually new understanding of how human fibroblasts decide whether DNA damage is beyond repair and senesce. Model and data imply that the G1-S transition is regulated by a bistable hysteresis switch with respect to Cdk2 activity, which in turn is controlled by the Cdk2/p21 ratio rather than cyclin abundance. We experimentally confirm the resulting predictions that to induce senescence i) in healthy cells both high initial and elevated background DNA damage are necessary and sufficient, and ii) in already damaged cells much lower additional DNA damage is sufficient. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of a) how noise in protein abundances allows cells to overcome the G1-S arrest even with substantial DNA damage, potentially leading to neoplasia, and b) how accumulating DNA damage with age increasingly sensitizes cells for senescence.",

    "synopsis": "Adaptation of the cellular metabolism to varying external conditions is brought about by regulated changes in the activity of enzymes and transporters. Hormone-dependent reversible enzyme phosphorylation and concentration changes of reactants and allosteric effectors are the major types of rapid kinetic enzyme regulation, whereas on longer time scales changes in protein abundance may also become operative. Here, we used a comprehensive mathematical model of the hepatic glucose metabolism of rat hepatocytes to decipher the relative importance of different regulatory modes and their mutual interdependencies in the hepatic control of plasma glucose homeostasis.Model simulations reveal significant differences in the capability of liver metabolism to counteract variations of plasma glucose in different physiological settings (starvation, ad libitum nutrient supply, diabetes). Changes in enzyme abundances adjust the metabolic output to the anticipated physiological demand but may turn into a regulatory disadvantage if sudden unexpected changes of the external conditions occur. Allosteric and hormonal control of enzyme activities allow the liver to assume a broad range of metabolic states and may even fully reverse flux changes resulting from changes of enzyme abundances alone. Metabolic control analysis reveals that control of the hepatic glucose metabolism is mainly exerted by enzymes alone, which are differently controlled by alterations in enzyme abundance, reversible phosphorylation, and allosteric effects.In hepatic glucose metabolism, regulation of enzyme activities by changes of reactants, allosteric effects, and reversible phosphorylation is equally important as changes in protein abundance of key regulatory enzymes.",

    "synopsis": "Progress in the development of therapeutic interventions to treat or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease has been hampered by lack of efficacy and unforeseen side effects in human clinical trials. This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we extended this model to include the main processes involved in passive and active immunisation against A\u03b2 and then demonstrate the effects of this intervention on soluble A\u03b2, plaques, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in small reductions in levels of soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by neuropathological observations in Alzheimer patients immunised against A\u03b2. Since, soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our model suggests that immunotherapy against A\u03b2 may not be effective unless it is performed very early in the disease process or combined with other therapies.",

    "synopsis": "Transient changes in striatal dopamine (DA) concentration are considered to encode a reward prediction error (RPE) in reinforcement learning tasks. Often, a phasic DA change occurs concomitantly with a dip in striatal acetylcholine (ACh), whereas other neuromodulators, such as adenosine (Adn), change slowly. There are abundant adenylyl cyclase (AC) coupled GPCRs for these neuromodulators in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which play important roles in plasticity. However, little is known about the interaction between these neuromodulators via GPCRs. The interaction between these transient neuromodulator changes and the effect on cAMP/PKA signaling via Golf- and Gi/o-coupled GPCR are studied here using quantitative kinetic modeling. The simulations suggest that, under basal conditions, cAMP/PKA signaling could be significantly inhibited in D1R+ MSNs via ACh/M4R/Gi/o and an ACh dip is required to gate a subset of D1R/Golf-dependent PKA activation. Furthermore, the interaction between ACh dip and DA peak, via D1R and M4R, is synergistic. In a similar fashion, PKA signaling in D2+ MSNs is under basal inhibition via D2R/Gi/o and a DA dip leads to a PKA increase by disinhibiting A2aR/Golf, but D2+ MSNs could also respond to the DA peak via other intracellular pathways. This study highlights the similarity between the two types of MSNs in terms of high basal AC inhibition by Gi/o and the importance of interactions between Gi/o and Golf signaling, but at the same time predicts differences between them with regard to the sign of RPE responsible for PKA activation.Dopamine transients are considered to carry reward-related signal in reinforcement learning.

    "synopsis": "Tetrahydrofolate (THF) and its one-carbon derivatives, collectively termed folates, are essential cofactors, but are inherently unstable. While it is clear that chemical oxidation can cleave folates or damage their pterin precursors, very little is known about enzymatic damage to these molecules or about whether the folate biosynthesis pathway responds adaptively to damage to its end-products. The presence of a duplication of the gene encoding the folate biosynthesis enzyme 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (FolK) in many sequenced bacterial genomes combined with a strong chromosomal clustering of the folK gene with panB, encoding the 5,10-methylene-THF-dependent enzyme ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, led us to infer that PanB has a side activity that cleaves 5,10-methylene-THF, yielding a pterin product that is recycled by FolK. Genetic and metabolic analyses of Escherichia coli strains showed that overexpression of PanB leads to accumulation of the likely folate cleavage product 6-hydroxymethylpterin and other pterins in cells and medium, and-unexpectedly-to a 46% increase in total folate content. In silico modeling of the folate biosynthesis pathway showed that these observations are consistent with the in vivo cleavage of 5,10-methylene-THF by a side-activity of PanB, with FolK-mediated recycling of the pterin cleavage product, and with regulation of folate biosynthesis by folates or their damage products.",

We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase \u03b2 (CaMKK\u03b2). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy. This may be required to maintain protein homoeostasis and deliver metabolite intermediates for biosynthetic processes.",

    "synopsis": "After DNA damage, the cell cycle is arrested to avoid propagation of mutations. Arrest in G2 phase is initiated by ATM-/ATR-dependent signaling that inhibits mitosis-promoting kinases such as Plk1. At the same time, Plk1 can counteract ATR-dependent signaling and is required for eventual resumption of the cell cycle. However, what determines when Plk1 activity can resume remains unclear. Here, we use FRET-based reporters to show that a global spread of ATM activity on chromatin and phosphorylation of ATM targets including KAP1 control Plk1 re-activation. These phosphorylations are rapidly counteracted by the chromatin-bound phosphatase Wip1, allowing cell cycle restart despite persistent ATM activity present at DNA lesions. Combining experimental data and mathematical modeling, we propose a model for how the minimal duration of cell cycle arrest is controlled. Our model shows how cell cycle restart can occur before completion of DNA repair and suggests a mechanism for checkpoint adaptation in human cells.",

We present the effects of estrogen as a risk factor on the dynamics of breast cancer. We develop a deterministic mathematical model showing general dynamics of breast cancer with immune response. This is a four-population model that includes tumor cells, host cells, immune cells, and estrogen. The effects of estrogen are then incorporated in the model. The results show that the presence of extra estrogen increases the risk of developing breast cancer.",

Understanding the cellular decision to commit to S\u00a0phase requires a quantitative description of these interactions. We apply quantitative imaging of single human cells to track the expression of G1/S regulators and use these data to parametrize a stochastic mathematical model of the G1/S transition. We show that a rapid, proteolytic, double-negative feedback loop between Cdk2:Cyclin and the Cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1) drives a switch-like entry into S phase. Furthermore, our model predicts that increasing Emi1 levels throughout S phase are critical in maintaining irreversibility of the G1/S transition, which we validate using Emi1 knockdown and live imaging of G1/S reporters. This work provides insight into the general design principles of the signaling networks governing the temporally abrupt transitions between cell-cycle phases.",

    "synopsis": "Even in the early stages of their development, tumours are not simply a homogeneous grouping of mutant cells; rather, they develop in tandem with normal tissue cells, and also recruit other cell types including lymphatic cells and the endothelial cells required for the development of a blood supply. It has been repeatedly seen that macrophages form a significant proportion of the tumour mass, and that they can have a variety of effects upon the tumour, leading to a delicate balance between growth promotion and inhibition. This paper develops a model for the early, avascular growth of a tumour, concentrating on the inhibitory effect of macrophages due to their cytolytic activity. It is shown that such an immune response is not sufficient to prevent growth, due to it being a second-order process with respect to the density of the tumour cells present. However, the presence of macrophages does have important effects on the tumour composition, and the authors perform a detailed bifurcation analysis of their model to clarify this. An extended model is also considered which incorporates addition of exogenous chemical regulators. In this case, the model admits the possibility of tumour regression, and the therapeutic implications of this are discussed.",

    "synopsis": "The notion of feedback is fundamental for understanding signal transduction networks. Feedback loops attenuate or amplify signals, change the network dynamics and modify the input-output relationships between the signal and the target. Negative feedback provides robustness to noise and adaptation to perturbations, but as a double-edged sword can prevent effective pathway inhibition by a drug. Positive feedback brings about switch-like network responses and can convert analog input signals into digital outputs, triggering cell fate decisions and phenotypic changes. We show how a multitude of protein-protein interactions creates hidden feedback loops in signal transduction cascades. Drug treatments that interfere with feedback regulation can cause unexpected adverse effects. Combinatorial molecular interactions generated by pathway crosstalk and feedback loops often bypass the block caused by targeted therapies against oncogenic mutated kinases. We discuss mechanisms of drug resistance caused by network adaptations and suggest that development of effective drug combinations requires understanding of how feedback loops modulate drug responses.",

Quantitative measurements of cell-cycle dynamics in single cells showed that despite variability in G1-, S-, and G2 phases, duration of mitosis is short and remarkably constant. Surprisingly, there is no correlation between cell-cycle length and mitotic duration, suggesting that mitosis is temporally insulated from variability in earlier cell-cycle phases. By combining live cell imaging and computational modeling, we showed that positive feedback is the molecular mechanism underlying the temporal insulation of mitosis. Perturbing positive feedback gave rise to a sluggish, variable entry and progression through mitosis and uncoupled duration of mitosis from variability in cell cycle length. We show that positive feedback is important to keep mitosis short, constant, and temporally insulated and anticipate it might be a commonly used regulatory strategy to create modularity in other biological systems.",

    "synopsis": "Wnt signaling plays an important role in both oncogenesis and development. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in stabilization of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. Recent studies have demonstrated that axin, which coordinates beta-catenin degradation, is itself degraded. Although the key molecules required for transducing a Wnt signal have been identified, a quantitative understanding of this pathway has been lacking. We have developed a mathematical model for the canonical Wnt pathway that describes the interactions among the core components: Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled, GSK3beta, APC, axin, beta-catenin, and TCF. Using a system of differential equations, the model incorporates the kinetics of protein-protein interactions, protein synthesis/degradation, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. We initially defined a reference state of kinetic, thermodynamic, and flux data from experiments using Xenopus extracts. Predictions based on the analysis of the reference state were used iteratively to develop a more refined model from which we analyzed the effects of prolonged and transient Wnt stimulation on beta-catenin and axin turnover. We predict several unusual features of the Wnt pathway, some of which we tested experimentally. An insight from our model, which we confirmed experimentally, is that the two scaffold proteins axin and APC promote the formation of degradation complexes in very different ways. We can also explain the importance of axin degradation in amplifying and sharpening the Wnt signal, and we show that the dependence of axin degradation on APC is an essential part of an unappreciated regulatory loop that prevents the accumulation of beta-catenin at decreased APC concentrations. By applying control analysis to our mathematical model, we demonstrate the modular design, sensitivity, and robustness of the Wnt pathway and derive an explicit expression for tumor suppression and oncogenicity.",

    "title": "Regulation of ERK-MAPK signaling in human epidermis.",
    "synopsis": "The skin is largely comprised of keratinocytes within the interfollicular epidermis. Over approximately two weeks these cells differentiate and traverse the thickness of the skin. The stage of differentiation is therefore reflected in the positions of cells within the tissue, providing a convenient axis along which to study the signaling events that occur in situ during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, over this extended two-week timescale. The canonical ERK-MAPK signaling cascade (Raf-1, MEK-1/2 and ERK-1/2) has been implicated in controlling diverse cellular behaviors, including proliferation and differentiation. While the molecular interactions involved in signal transduction through this cascade have been well characterized in cell culture experiments, our understanding of how this sequence of events unfolds to determine cell fate within a homeostatic tissue environment has not been fully characterized.We measured the abundance of total and phosphorylated ERK-MAPK signaling proteins within interfollicular keratinocytes in transverse cross-sections of human epidermis using immunofluorescence microscopy. To investigate these data we developed a mathematical model of the signaling cascade using a normalized-Hill differential equation formalism.These data show coordinated variation in the abundance of phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components across the epidermis. Statistical analysis of these data shows that associations between phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components which correspond to canonical molecular interactions are dependent upon spatial position within the epidermis. The model demonstrates that the spatial profile of activation for ERK-MAPK signaling components across the epidermis may be maintained in a cell-autonomous fashion by an underlying spatial gradient in calcium signaling.Our data demonstrate an extended phospho-protein profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components across the epidermis in situ, and statistical associations in these data indicate canonical ERK-MAPK interactions underlie this spatial profile of ERK-MAPK activation. Using mathematical modelling we have demonstrated that spatially varying calcium signaling components across the epidermis may be sufficient to maintain the spatial profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components in a cell-autonomous manner. These findings may have significant implications for the wide range of cancer drugs which therapeutically target ERK-MAPK signaling components.",

    "synopsis": "Following DNA damage caused by exogenous sources, such as ionizing radiation, the tumour suppressor p53 mediates cell cycle arrest via expression of the CDK inhibitor, p21. However, the role of p21 in maintaining genomic stability in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agents is unclear. Here, using live single-cell measurements of p21 protein in proliferating cultures, we show that naturally occurring DNA damage incurred over S-phase causes p53-dependent accumulation of p21 during mother G2- and daughter G1-phases. High p21 levels mediate G1 arrest via CDK inhibition, yet lower levels have no impact on G1 progression, and the ubiquitin ligases CRL4Cdt2 and SCFSkp2 couple to degrade p21 prior to the G1/S transition. Mathematical modelling reveals that a bistable switch, created by CRL4Cdt2, promotes irreversible S-phase entry by keeping p21 levels low, preventing premature S-phase exit upon DNA damage. Thus, we characterize how p21 regulates the proliferation-quiescence decision to maintain genomic stability.",

    "synopsis": "One proposed mechanism of tumour escape from immune surveillance is tumour up-regulation of the cell surface ligand FasL, which can lead to apoptosis of Fas receptor (Fas) positive lymphocytes. Based upon this 'counterattack', we have developed a mathematical model involving tumour cell-lymphocyte interaction, cell surface expression of Fas/FasL, and their secreted soluble forms. The model predicts that (a) the production of soluble forms of Fas and FasL will lead to the down-regulation of the immune response; (b) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inactivation should lead to increased membrane FasL and result in a higher rate of Fas-mediated apoptosis for lymphocytes than for tumour cells. Recent studies on cancer patients lend support for these predictions. The clinical implications are two-fold. Firstly, the use of broad spectrum MMP inhibitors as anti-angiogenic agents may be compromised by their adverse effect on tumour FasL up-regulation. Also, Fas/FasL interactions may have an impact on the outcome of numerous ongoing immunotherapeutic trials since the final common pathway of all these approaches is the transduction of death signals within the tumour cell.",

    "synopsis": "In this paper, we propose and analyse a mathematical model for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood. We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.",

    "synopsis": "Recent experimental data have shown that HIV-specific CD4 T cells provide a very important target for HIV replication. We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such autocatalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV-specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.",

    "synopsis": "Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MC1R) receptors stimulates B-Raf and C-Raf isoforms that regulate the dynamics of MAPK1,2 signaling. Network topology motifs in mammalian cells include feed-forward and feedback loops and bifans where signals from two upstream molecules integrate to modulate the activity of two downstream molecules. We computationally modeled and experimentally tested signal processing in the FGFR/MC1R/B-Raf/C-Raf/MAPK1,2 network in human melanoma cells; identifying 7 regulatory loops and a bifan motif. Signaling from FGFR leads to sustained activation of MAPK1,2, whereas signaling from MC1R results in transient activation of MAPK1,2. The dynamics of MAPK activation depends critically on the expression level and connectivity to C-Raf, which is critical for a sustained MAPK1,2 response. A partially incoherent bifan motif with a feedback loop acts as a logic gate to integrate signals and regulate duration of activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Further reducing a 106-node ordinary differential equations network encompassing the complete network to a 6-node network encompassing rate-limiting processes sustains the feedback loops and the bifan, providing sufficient information to predict biological responses.",

    "synopsis": "Multisubunit cytokine receptors such as the heterotrimeric receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2) are ubiquitous in hematopoeitic cell types of importance in biotechnology and are crucial regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation behavior. Dynamics of cytokine/receptor endocytic trafficking can significantly impact cell responses through effects of receptor down-regulation and ligand depletion, and in turn are governed by ligand/receptor binding properties. We describe here a computational model for trafficking dynamics of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) system, which is able to predict T cell proliferation responses to IL-2. This model comprises kinetic equations describing binding, internalization, and postendocytic sorting of IL-2 and IL-2R, including an experimentally derived dependence of cell proliferation rate on these properties. Computational results from this model predict that IL-2 depletion can be reduced by decreasing its binding affinity for the IL-2R betagamma subunit relative to the alpha subunit at endosomal pH, as a result of enhanced ligand sorting to recycling vis-\u00e0-vis degradation, and that an IL-2 analogue with such altered binding properties should exhibit increased potency for stimulating the T cell proliferation response. These results are in agreement with our recent experimental findings for the IL-2 analogue termed 2D1 [Fallon, E. M. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 6790-6797]. Thus, this type of model may enable prediction of beneficial cytokine/receptor binding properties to aid development of molecular design criteria for improvements in applications such as in vivo cytokine therapies and in vitro hematopoietic cell bioreactors.",

Melanocytic transformation is thought to occur by sequential accumulation of genetic and molecular alterations able to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) and/or the PI3K/AKT (AKT) signalling pathways. Specifically, mutations of B-RAF activate MAPK pathway resulting in cell cycle progression and apoptosis prevention. According to these findings, MAPK and AKT pathways may represent promising therapeutic targets for an otherwise devastating disease.Here we show a computational model able to simulate the main biochemical and metabolic interactions in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways potentially involved in melanoma development. Overall, this computational approach may accelerate the drug discovery process and encourages the identification of novel pathway activators with consequent development of novel antioncogenic compounds to overcome tumor cell resistance to conventional therapeutic agents.

    "synopsis": "Oncogenesis results from changes in kinetics or in abundance of proteins in signal transduction networks. Recently, it was shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene product, and might well be dispersed over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most important, and how can the existing molecular information be used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not? We implement a new method to help address such questions. We apply control analysis to a detailed kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase network. We determine the control of each reaction with respect to three biologically relevant characteristics of the output of this network: the amplitude, duration and integrated output of the transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We confirm that control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small proportion of reactions substantially control signalling. In particular, the activity of Raf is in control of all characteristics of the transient profile of ERK phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most reactions that really matter for one signalling characteristic are also important for the other characteristics. Our analysis also predicts the effects of mutations and changes in gene expression.",

    "synopsis": "Even in the early stages of their development, tumours are not simply a homogeneous grouping of mutant cells; rather, they develop in tandem with normal tissue cells, and also recruit other cell types including lymphatic cells and the endothelial cells required for the development of a blood supply. It has been repeatedly seen that macrophages form a significant proportion of the tumour mass, and that they can have a variety of effects upon the tumour, leading to a delicate balance between growth promotion and inhibition. This paper develops a model for the early, avascular growth of a tumour, concentrating on the inhibitory effect of macrophages due to their cytolytic activity. It is shown that such an immune response is not sufficient to prevent growth, due to it being a second-order process with respect to the density of the tumour cells present. However, the presence of macrophages does have important effects on the tumour composition, and the authors perform a detailed bifurcation analysis of their model to clarify this. An extended model is also considered which incorporates addition of exogenous chemical regulators. In this case, the model admits the possibility of tumour regression, and the therapeutic implications of this are discussed.",

    "synopsis": "Studies in animals and humans suggest that the diurnal pattern in plasma melatonin levels is due to the hormone's rates of synthesis, circulatory infusion and clearance, circadian control of synthesis onset and offset, environmental lighting conditions, and error in the melatonin immunoassay. A two-dimensional linear differential equation model of the hormone is formulated and is used to analyze plasma melatonin levels in 18 normal healthy male subjects during a constant routine. Recently developed Bayesian statistical procedures are used to incorporate correctly the magnitude of the immunoassay error into the analysis. The estimated parameters [median (range)] were clearance half-life of 23.67 (14.79-59.93) min, synthesis onset time of 2206 (1940-0029), synthesis offset time of 0621 (0246-0817), and maximum N-acetyltransferase activity of 7.17(2.34-17.93) pmol x l(-1) x min(-1). All were in good agreement with values from previous reports. The difference between synthesis offset time and the phase of the core temperature minimum was 1 h 15 min (-4 h 38 min-2 h 43 min). The correlation between synthesis onset and the dim light melatonin onset was 0.93. Our model provides a more physiologically plausible estimate of the melatonin synthesis onset time than that given by the dim light melatonin onset and the first reliable means of estimating the phase of synthesis offset. Our analysis shows that the circadian and pharmacokinetics parameters of melatonin can be reliably estimated from a single model.",

    "synopsis": "Clinical trial simulation (CTS) was used to select a robust design to test the hypothesis that a new treatment was effective for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Typically, a parallel group, placebo controlled, 12-week trial in 200-400 AD patients would be used to establish drug effect relative to placebo (i.e., Ho: Drug Effect = 0). We evaluated if a crossover design would allow smaller and shorter duration trials.A family of plausible drug and disease models describing the time course of the AD assessment scale (ADAS-Cog) was developed based on Phase I data and literature reports of other treatments for AD. The models included pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, disease progression, and placebo components. Eight alternative trial designs were explored via simulation. One hundred replicates of each combination of drug and disease model and trial design were simulated. A 'positive trial' reflecting drug activity was declared considering both a dose trend test (p < 0.05) and pair-wise comparisons to placebo (p < 0.025).A 4 x 4 Latin Square design was predicted to have at least 80% power to detect activity across a range of drug and disease models. The trial design was subsequently implemented and the trial was completed. Based on the results of the actual trial, a conclusive decision about further development was taken. The crossover design provided enhanced power over a parallel group design due to the lower residual variability.CTS aided the decision to use a more efficient proof of concept trial design, leading to savings of up to US 4 M dollars in direct costs and a firm decision 8-12 months earlier than a 12-week parallel group trial.",

A previous model of mammalian polyamine metabolism showed that S-adenosyl methionine availability could play a key role in polyamine homeostasis. To get a deeper insight in this prediction, we have built a combined model by integration of the previously published polyamine model and one-carbon and glutathione metabolism model, published by different research groups. The combined model is robust and it is able to achieve physiological steady-state values, as well as to reproduce the predictions of the individual models. Furthermore, a transition between two versions of our model with new regulatory factors added properly simulates the switch in methionine adenosyl transferase isozymes occurring when the liver enters in proliferative conditions. The combined model is useful to support the previous prediction on the role of S-adenosyl methionine availability in polyamine homeostasis. Furthermore, it could be easily adapted to get deeper insights on the connections of polyamines with energy metabolism.",

    "synopsis": "The molecular machinery of cell cycle control is known in more detail for budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, than for any other eukaryotic organism. In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1-3 and Clb1-6) in coordinating the events of DNA synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the molecular events controlling \"Start\" (the commitment step to a new round of chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and \"Finish\" (the transition from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants. The model accounts for many details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell cycle control in budding yeast.",

    "synopsis": "Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005-0.1 microM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.",

    "synopsis": "Transcription by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is regulated by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation. However, why and how Ca(2+) oscillation regulates NFAT activity remain elusive. NFAT is dephosphorylated by Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate transcription. We analyzed the kinetics of dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. We show that Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation proceeds rapidly, while the rephosphorylation and nuclear transport of NFAT proceed slowly. Therefore, after brief Ca(2+) stimulation, dephosphorylated NFAT has a lifetime of several minutes in the cytoplasm. Thus, Ca(2+) oscillation induces a build-up of dephosphorylated NFAT in the cytoplasm, allowing effective nuclear translocation, provided that the oscillation interval is shorter than the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT. We also show that Ca(2+) oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the translocation of NFAT than continuous Ca(2+) signaling. Thus, the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working memory of Ca(2+) signals and enables the control of NFAT nuclear translocation by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation at a reduced cost of Ca(2+) signaling.",

To demonstrate this hypothesis, we couple a minimal model of glycolytic oscillations to a minimal model for activity-dependent bursting in islets.

The models suggest that an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response is required to control the virus. We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence of antigen. Infection and depletion of CD4(+) T helper cells interfere with CTL memory generation, resulting in persistent viral replication and disease progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected patients, specific treatment schedules, either including deliberate drug holidays or antigenic boosts of the immune system, can lead to a re-establishment of CTL memory. Whether such treatment regimes would lead to long-term immunologic control deserves investigation under carefully controlled conditions.",

    "synopsis": "Memory is a central characteristic of immune responses. It is defined as an elevated number of specific immune cells that remain after resolution of infection and can protect the host against reinfection. The evolution of immunological memory is subject to debate. The advantages of memory discussed so far include protection from reinfection, control of chronic infection, and the transfer of immune function to the next generation. Mathematical models are used to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of immunological memory: the duration of memory can regulate the degree of competition between different pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides lasting protection against reinfection, it may also allow an inferior pathogen species to persist. This can be detrimental for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. On the other hand, a shorter duration of memory ensures that an inferior pathogen species is excluded. This can be beneficial for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence of pathogen diversity memory is always expected to evolve to a long duration, under specific circumstances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations in the presence of pathogen diversity.",

    "synopsis": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses are required to fight many diseases such as viral infections and tumors. At the same time, they can cause disease when induced inappropriately. Which factors regulate CTL and decide whether they should remain silent or react is open to debate. The phenomenon called cross-priming has received attention in this respect. That is, CTL expansion occurs if antigen is recognized on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is in contrast to direct presentation where antigen is seen on the surface of the target cells (e.g. infected cells or tumor cells). Here we introduce a mathematical model, which takes the phenomenon of cross-priming into account. We propose a new mechanism of regulation which is implicit in the dynamics of the CTL: According to the model, the ability of a CTL response to become established depends on the ratio of cross-presentation to direct presentation of the antigen. If this ratio is relatively high, CTL responses are likely to become established. If this ratio is relatively low, tolerance is the likely outcome. The behavior of the model includes a parameter region where the outcome depends on the initial conditions. We discuss our results with respect to the idea of self/non-self discrimination and the danger signal hypothesis. We apply the model to study the role of CTL in cancer initiation, cancer evolution/progression, and therapeutic vaccination against cancers.",

    "synopsis": "Tetrahydrofolate (THF) and its one-carbon derivatives, collectively termed folates, are essential cofactors, but are inherently unstable. While it is clear that chemical oxidation can cleave folates or damage their pterin precursors, very little is known about enzymatic damage to these molecules or about whether the folate biosynthesis pathway responds adaptively to damage to its end-products. The presence of a duplication of the gene encoding the folate biosynthesis enzyme 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (FolK) in many sequenced bacterial genomes combined with a strong chromosomal clustering of the folK gene with panB, encoding the 5,10-methylene-THF-dependent enzyme ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, led us to infer that PanB has a side activity that cleaves 5,10-methylene-THF, yielding a pterin product that is recycled by FolK.

    "synopsis": "On the basis of a detailed model of yeast glycolysis, the effect of intercellular dynamics is analysed theoretically. The model includes the main steps of anaerobic glycolysis, and the production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of acetaldehyde is included, since it has been hypothesized that this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the kinetic parameter, the single-cell model shows both stationary and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data with respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of dynamical modes, such as synchronous oscillations, and different kinds of asynchronous behavior. These oscillations can co-exist, leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the various process on synchronization is characterized quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally. It is concluded either that addition to the transmembrane exchange of acetaldehyde, other processes may contribute to intercellular coupling, or that intracellular regulator feedback plays a role in the acceleration of the synchronization. for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally.

Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy stopped-flow measurements used the fluorescent GTP analogue, mantGTP (2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)GTP), to determine rate constants for binding and release of neurofibromin. Quenched flow measurements provided the kinetics of the hydrolytic cleavage step. The fluorescent phosphate sensor, MDCC-PBP was used to measure phosphate release kinetics. Phosphate-water oxygen exchange, using (18)O-substituted GTP and inorganic phosphate (P(i)), was used to determine the extent of reversal of the hydrolysis step and of P(i) binding. The data show that neurofibromin and P(i) dissociate from the NF1.Ras.GDP.P(i) complex with identical kinetics, which are 3-fold slower than the preceding cleavage step. A model is presented in which the P(i) release is associated with the change of Ras from \"GTP\" to \"GDP\" conformation. In this model, the conformation change on P(i) release causes the large change in affinity of neurofibromin, which then dissociates rapidly.",

    "synopsis": "Riluzole is known to be of therapeutic use in the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of riluzole on ion currents in cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (dHSkMCs). Western blotting revealed the protein expression of alpha-subunits for both large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK(Ca)) channel and Na+ channel (Na(v)1.5) in these cells. Riluzole could reduce the frequency of spontaneous beating in dHSkMCs. In whole-cell configuration, riluzole suppressed voltage-gated Na+ current (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 2.3 microM. Riluzole (10 microM) also effectively increased Ca2+-activated K+ current (I(K(Ca))) which could be reversed by iberiotoxin (200 nM) and paxilline (1 microM), but not by apamin (200 nM). In inside-out patches, when applied to the inside of the cell membrane, riluzole (10 microM) increased BK(Ca)-channel activity with a decrease in mean closed time. Simulation studies also unraveled that both decreased conductance of I(Na) and increased conductance of I(K(Ca)) utilized to mimic riluzole actions in skeletal muscle cells could combine to decrease the amplitude of action potentials and increase the repolarization of action potentials. Taken together, inhibition of I(Na) and stimulation of BK(Ca)-channel activity caused by this drug are partly, if not entirely, responsible for its muscle relaxant actions in clinical setting.",

    "synopsis": "Clinical investigations prove that blue light irradiation reduces the severity of psoriasis vulgaris. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in the management of this condition remain poorly defined. Despite the encouraging results of the clinical studies, no clear guidelines are specified in the literature for the irradiation scheme regime of blue light-based therapy for psoriasis. We investigated the underlying mechanism of blue light irradiation of psoriatic skin, and tested the hypothesis that regulation of proliferation is a key process. We implemented a mechanistic model of cellular epidermal dynamics to analyze whether a temporary decrease of keratinocytes hyper-proliferation can explain the outcome of phototherapy with blue light. Our results suggest that the main effect of blue light on keratinocytes impacts the proliferative cells. They show that the decrease in the keratinocytes proliferative capacity is sufficient to induce a transient decrease in the severity of psoriasis. To study the impact of the therapeutic regime on the efficacy of psoriasis treatment, we performed simulations for different combinations of the treatment parameters, i.e., length of treatment, fluence (also referred to as dose), and intensity. These simulations indicate that high efficacy is achieved by regimes with long duration and high fluence levels, regardless of the chosen intensity. Our modeling approach constitutes a framework for testing diverse hypotheses on the underlying mechanism of blue light-based phototherapy, and for designing effective strategies for the treatment of psoriasis.",

    "synopsis": "Model based design plays a fundamental role in synthetic biology. Exploiting modularity, i.e. using biological parts and interconnecting them to build new and more complex biological circuits is one of the key issues. In this context, mathematical models have been used to generate predictions of the behavior of the designed device. Designers not only want the ability to predict the circuit behavior once all its components have been determined, but also to help on the design and selection of its biological parts, i.e. to provide guidelines for the experimental implementation. This is tantamount to obtaining proper values of the model parameters, for the circuit behavior results from the interplay between model structure and parameters tuning. However, determining crisp values for parameters of the involved parts is not a realistic approach. Uncertainty is ubiquitous to biology, and the characterization of biological parts is not exempt from it. Moreover, the desired dynamical behavior for the designed circuit usually results from a trade-off among several goals to be optimized.We propose the use of a multi-objective optimization tuning framework to get a model-based set of guidelines for the selection of the kinetic parameters required to build a biological device with desired behavior. The design criteria are encoded in the formulation of the objectives and optimization problem itself. As a result, on the one hand the designer obtains qualitative regions/intervals of values of the circuit parameters giving rise to the predefined circuit behavior; on the other hand, he obtains useful information for its guidance in the implementation process. These parameters are chosen so that they can effectively be tuned at the wet-lab, i.e. they are effective biological tuning knobs. To show the proposed approach, the methodology is applied to the design of a well known biological circuit: a genetic incoherent feed-forward circuit showing adaptive behavior.The proposed multi-objective optimization design framework is able to provide effective guidelines to tune biological parameters so as to achieve a desired circuit behavior. Moreover, it is easy to analyze the impact of the context on the synthetic device to be designed. That is, one can analyze how the presence of a downstream load influences the performance of the designed circuit, and take it into account.",

Cdk1 activity peaks at mitosis, driven by periodic degradation of cyclins A and B. In contrast, Cdk2 activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, despite a constant level of its partner, cyclin E. Cyclin E degrades at a fixed time after fertilization, normally corresponding to the midblastula transition. Based on published data and new experiments, we constructed a mathematical model in which: (1) oscillations in Cdk2 activity depend upon changes in phosphorylation, (2) Cdk2 participates in a negative feedback loop with the inhibitory kinase Wee1; (3) cyclin E is cooperatively removed from the oscillatory system; and (4) removed cyclin E is degraded by a pathway activated by cyclin E/Cdk2 itself. The model's predictions about embryos injected with Xic1, a stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin E/Cdk2, were experimentally validated.",

A large amount of information is available about the enzymes that catalyse individual reaction steps in the cycle, from methionine to S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine, and the removal of mass from the cycle by the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational \"experiments\" that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation and dietary deficiencies.",

    "synopsis": "Human cells that suffer mild DNA damage can enter a reversible state of growth arrest known as quiescence. This decision to temporarily exit the cell cycle is essential to prevent the propagation of mutations, and most cancer cells harbor defects in the underlying control system. Here we present a mechanistic mathematical model to study the proliferation-quiescence decision in nontransformed human cells. We show that two bistable switches, the restriction point (RP) and the G1/S transition, mediate this decision by integrating DNA damage and mitogen signals. In particular, our data suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Cip1/Waf1), which is expressed in response to DNA damage, promotes quiescence by blocking positive feedback loops that facilitate G1 progression downstream of serum stimulation. Intriguingly, cells exploit bistability in the RP to convert graded p21 and mitogen signals into an all-or-nothing cell-cycle response. The same mechanism creates a window of opportunity where G1 cells that have passed the RP can revert to quiescence if exposed to DNA damage. We present experimental evidence that cells gradually lose this ability to revert to quiescence as they progress through G1 and that the onset of rapid p21 degradation at the G1/S transition prevents this response altogether, insulating S phase from mild, endogenous DNA damage. Thus, two bistable switches conspire in the early cell cycle to provide both sensitivity and robustness to external stimuli.",

To begin to address this issue, we created a computational model of the vertebrate UPR that was entrained upon and then validated against experimental data. As part of this validation, the model successfully predicted the phenotypes of cells with lesions in UPR signaling, including a surprising and previously unreported differential role for the eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase GADD34 in exacerbating severe stress but ameliorating mild stress. We then used the model to test the functional importance of a feedforward circuit within the PERK/CHOP axis and of cross-regulatory control of BiP and CHOP expression. We found that the wiring structure of the UPR appears to balance the ability of the response to remain sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress and to be deactivated rapidly by improved protein-folding conditions. This model should serve as a valuable resource for further exploring the regulatory logic of the UPR.",

    "synopsis": "A mathematical model examined a potential therapy for controlling viral infections using genetically modified viruses. The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend the survival of AIDS patients.",

Nevertheless, the immune response to influenza virus infection is complex and remains largely unknown. In this paper we focus in the innate immune response to influenza virus using a mathematical model, based on interferon-induced resistance to infection of respiratory epithelial cells and the clearance of infected cells by natural killers. Simulation results show the importance of IFN-I to prevent new infections in epithelial cells and to stop the viral explosion during the first two days after infection. Nevertheless, natural killers response might be the most relevant for the first depletion in viral load due to the elimination of infected cells. Based on the reproductive number, the innate immune response is important to control the infection, although it would not be enough to clear completely the virus. The effective coordination between innate and adaptive immune response is essential for the virus eradication.",

    "synopsis": "We present a simplified dynamical model of immune response to uncomplicated influenza A virus (IAV) infection, which focuses on the control of the infection by the innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is represented by interferon-induced resistance to infection of respiratory epithelial cells and by removal of infected cells by effector cells (cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells). Adaptive immunity is represented by virus-specific antibodies. Similar in spirit to the recent model of Bocharov and Romanyukha [1994. Mathematical model of antiviral immune response. III. Influenza A virus infection. J. Theor. Biol. 167, 323-360], the model is constructed as a system of 10 ordinary differential equations with 27 parameters characterizing the rates of various processes contributing to the course of disease. The parameters are derived from published experimental data or estimated so as to reproduce available data about the time course of IAV infection in a na\u00efve host. We explore the effect of initial viral load on the severity and duration of the disease, construct a phase diagram that sheds insight into the dynamics of the disease, and perform sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to explore which ones influence the most the onset, duration and severity of infection. To account for the variability and speed of adaptation of the adaptive response to a particular virus strain, we introduce a variable that quantifies the antigenic compatibility between the virus and the antibodies currently produced by the organism. We find that for small initial viral load the disease progresses through an asymptomatic course, for intermediate value it takes a typical course with constant duration and severity of infection but variable onset, and for large initial viral load the disease becomes severe. This behavior is robust to a wide range of parameter values. The absence of antibody response leads to recurrence of disease and appearance of a chronic state with nontrivial constant viral load.",

The aim of the present study was to develop a small-scale mathematical model based on easily attainable experimental data to explain differences in influenza kinetics induced by different virus strains in mice. To develop a three-dimensional ordinary differential equation model of influenza dynamics, the following variables were included: (i) viral pathogenicity (P), (ii) antiviral immune defense (D), and (iii) inflammation due to pro-inflammatory response (I). Influenza virus-induced symptoms (clinical score S) in mice provided the basis for calculations of P and I. Both, mono- and biphasic course of mild to severe influenza induced by three clinical A(H1N1)pdm09 strains and one European swine H1N2 virus were comparatively and quantitatively studied by fitting the mathematical model to the experimental data. The model hypothesizes reasons for mild and severe influenza with mono- as well as biphasic course of disease. According to modeling results, the second peak of the biphasic course of infection is caused by inflammation. The parameters (i) maximum primary pathogenicity, (ii) viral infection rate, and (iii) rate of activation of the immune system represent most important parameters that quantitatively characterize the different pattern of virus-specific influenza kinetics.",

A new model for HCV infection is proposed, based on various dynamical processes that occur during the infection that are described in the literature. This new model is analysed, and three steady state branches of solutions are found when there is no stem cell generation of hepatocytes. Unusually, the branch of infected solutions that connects the uninfected branch and the pure infection branch can be found analytically and always includes a limit point, subject to a few conditions on the parameters. When the action of stem cells is included, the bifurcation between the pure infection and infected branches unfolds, leaving a single branch of infected solutions. It is shown that this model can generate various viral load profiles that have been described in the literature, which is confirmed by fitting the model to four viral load datasets. Suggestions for possible changes in treatment are made based on the model.",

The model accounts for important details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell cycle control in stalked C. crescentus cell. It reproduces protein time courses in wild-type cells, mimics correctly the phenotypes of many mutant strains, and predicts the phenotypes of currently uncharacterized mutants. Since many of the proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle of C. crescentus are conserved among many genera of alpha-proteobacteria, the proposed mechanism may be applicable to other species of importance in agriculture and medicine.",

    "synopsis": "During the early development of Xenopus laevis embryos, the first mitotic cell cycle is long (\u223c85 min) and the subsequent 11 cycles are short (\u223c30 min) and clock-like. Here we address the question of how the Cdk1 cell cycle oscillator changes between these two modes of operation. We found that the change can be attributed to an alteration in the balance between Wee1/Myt1 and Cdc25. The change in balance converts a circuit that acts like a positive-plus-negative feedback oscillator, with spikes of Cdk1 activation, to one that acts like a negative-feedback-only oscillator, with a shorter period and smoothly varying Cdk1 activity. Shortening the first cycle, by treating embryos with the Wee1A/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285, resulted in a dramatic reduction in embryo viability, and restoring the length of the first cycle in inhibitor-treated embryos with low doses of cycloheximide partially rescued viability. Computations with an experimentally parameterized mathematical model show that modest changes in the Wee1/Cdc25 ratio can account for the observed qualitative changes in the cell cycle. The high ratio in the first cycle allows the period to be long and tunable, and decreasing the ratio in the subsequent cycles allows the oscillator to run at a maximal speed. Thus, the embryo rewires its feedback regulation to meet two different developmental requirements during early development.",

    "synopsis": "MiRNAs, which are a family of small non-coding RNAs, regulate a broad array of physiological and developmental processes. However, their regulatory roles have remained largely mysterious. E2F is a positive regulator of cell cycle progression and also a potent inducer of apoptosis. Positive feedback loops in the regulation of Rb-E2F pathway are predicted and shown experimentally. Recently, it has been discovered that E2F induce a cluster of miRNAs called miR449. In turn, E2F is inhibited by miR449 through regulating different transcripts, thus forming negative feedback loops in the interaction network. Here, based on the integration of experimental evidence and quantitative data, we studied Rb-E2F pathway coupling the positive feedback loops and negative feedback loops mediated by miR449. Therefore, a mathematical model is constructed based in part on the model proposed in Yao-Lee et al. (2008) and nonlinear dynamical behaviors including the stability and bifurcations of the model are discussed. A comparison is given to reveal the implication of the fundamental differences of Rb-E2F pathway between regulation and deregulation of miR449. Coherent with the experiments it predicts that miR449 plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle progression and provides a twofold safety mechanism to avoid excessive E2F-induced proliferation by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis shows that the mechanisms of the negative regulation of miR449 to three different transcripts are quite distinctive which needs to be verified experimentally. This study may help us to analyze the whole cell cycle process mediated by other miRNAs more easily. A better knowledge of the dynamical behaviors of miRNAs mediated networks is also of interest for bio-engineering and artificial control.",

However, there is increasing evidence that osteocytes play important roles in the cycle of targeted bone remodeling, in serving as a significant source of RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis, and in secreting the bone formation inhibitor sclerostin. Moreover, there is also increasing interest in sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted bone formation inhibitor, and its role in regulating local response to changes in the bone microenvironment. Here we develop a cell population model of bone remodeling that includes the role of osteocytes, sclerostin, and allows for the possibility of RANKL expression by osteocyte cell populations. We have aimed to give a simple, yet still tractable, model that remains faithful to the underlying system based on the known literature. This model extends and complements many of the existing mathematical models for bone remodeling, but can be used to explore aspects of the process of bone remodeling that were previously beyond the scope of prior modeling work. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate that our model can be used to explore theoretically many of the qualitative features of the role of osteocytes in bone biology as presented in recent literature.",

    "title": "A mathematical model for lymphangiogenesis in normal and diabetic wounds.",
    "synopsis": "Several studies suggest that one possible cause of impaired wound healing is failed or insufficient lymphangiogenesis, that is the formation of new lymphatic capillaries. Although many mathematical models have been developed to describe the formation of blood capillaries (angiogenesis) very few have been proposed for the regeneration of the lymphatic network. Moreover, lymphangiogenesis is markedly distinct from angiogenesis, occurring at different times and in a different manner. Here a model of five ordinary differential equations is presented to describe the formation of lymphatic capillaries following a skin wound. The variables represent different cell densities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible the parameters are estimated from experimental and clinical data. The system is then solved numerically and the results are compared with the available biological literature. Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as a starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper understanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors involved. In particular, the balance between TGF-\u03b2 and VEGF levels, rather than their absolute values, is identified as crucial to effective lymphangiogenesis. In addition, the results indicate lowering the macrophage-mediated activation of TGF-\u03b2 and increasing the basal lymphatic endothelial cell growth rate, inter alia, as potential treatments. It is hoped the findings of this paper may be considered in the development of future experiments investigating novel lymphangiogenic therapies.",

    "synopsis": "Few of >150 published cell cycle modeling efforts use significant levels of data for tuning and validation. This reflects the difficultly to generate correlated quantitative data, and it points out a critical uncertainty in modeling efforts. To develop a data-driven model of cell cycle regulation, we used contiguous, dynamic measurements over two time scales (minutes and hours) calculated from static multiparametric cytometry data. The approach provided expression profiles of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and phospho-S10-histone H3. The model was built by integrating and modifying two previously published models such that the model outputs for cyclins A and B fit cyclin expression measurements and the activation of B cyclin/Cdk1 coincided with phosphorylation of histone H3. The model depends on Cdh1-regulated cyclin degradation during G1, regulation of B cyclin/Cdk1 activity by cyclin A/Cdk via Wee1, and transcriptional control of the mitotic cyclins that reflects some of the current literature. We introduced autocatalytic transcription of E2F, E2F regulated transcription of cyclin B, Cdc20/Cdh1 mediated E2F degradation, enhanced transcription of mitotic cyclins during late S/early G2 phase, and the sustained synthesis of cyclin B during mitosis. These features produced a model with good correlation between state variable output and real measurements. Since the method of data generation is extensible, this model can be continually modified based on new correlated, quantitative data.",

    "synopsis": "Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor that negatively regulates the functioning of T cell. Although the direct targets of PD-1 were not identified, its inhibitory action on the TCR signaling pathway was known much earlier. Recent experiments suggest that the PD-1 inhibits the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways at a very early stage \u2500 at the level of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of TCR and CD28 receptors. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the influence of inhibitory effect of PD-1 on the activation of early TCR and CD28 signaling molecules. Proposed model recaptures several quantitative experimental observations of PD-1 mediated inhibition. Model simulations show that PD-1 imposes a net inhibitory effect on the Lck kinase. Further, the inhibitory effect of PD-1 on the activation of TCR signaling molecules such as Zap70 and SLP76 is significantly enhanced by the PD-1 mediated inhibition of Lck. These results suggest a critical role for Lck as a mediator for PD-1 induced inhibition of TCR signaling network.

    "synopsis": "The metabolic biochemistry of folate biosynthesis and utilisation has evolved into a complex network of reactions. Although this complexity represents challenges to the field of folate research it has also provided a renewed source for antimetabolite targets. A range of improved folate chemotherapy continues to be developed and applied particularly to cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, new or better antifolates against infectious diseases remain much more elusive. In this paper we describe the assembly of a generic deterministic mathematical model of microbial folate metabolism. Our aim is to explore how a mathematical model could be used to explore the dynamics of this inherently complex set of biochemical reactions. Using the model it was found that: (1) a particular small set of folate intermediates are overrepresented, (2) inhibitory profiles can be quantified by the level of key folate products, (3) using the model to scan for the most effective combinatorial inhibitions of folate enzymes we identified specific targets which could complement current antifolates, and (4) the model substantiates the case for a substrate cycle in the folinic acid biosynthesis reaction. Our model is coded in the systems biology markup language and has been deposited in the BioModels Database (MODEL1511020000), this makes it accessible to the community as a whole.",

    "synopsis": "Human rabies was first recorded in ancient China in about 556 BC and is still one of the major public-health problems in China. From 1950 to 2015, 130,494 human rabies cases were reported in Mainland China with an average of 1977 cases per year. It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained recently on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We first construct a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and use the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. Then we modify the basic model by including both domestic and stray dogs and apply the model to simulate the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. To study the seasonality of rabies, in Section\u00a04 we further propose a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates and employ the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Section\u00a05 we add diffusion to the dog population in the basic SEIR model to obtain a reaction-diffusion equation model and determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium. Finally, in order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Section\u00a06 we propose a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and use the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively. Some discussions are provided in Section\u00a07.",

The regulatory network is cast into a quantitative computational model to investigate in a systematic fashion how these three proteins control the relevant genetic, biochemical and physiological properties of proliferating bacteria. Different controls for both swarmer and stalked cell cycles are represented in the mathematical scheme. The model is validated against observed phenotypes of wild-type cells and relevant mutants, and it predicts the phenotypes of novel mutants and of known mutants under novel experimental conditions. Because the cell cycle control proteins of Caulobacter are conserved across many species of alpha-proteobacteria, the model we are proposing here may be applicable to other genera of importance to agriculture and medicine (e.g., Rhizobium, Brucella).",

Oscillations occur when the balance of kinase and phosphatase rates in each cycle is in a range bounded by two critical values. The results suggest ways to arrest the mitotic oscillator by altering the maximum rates of the converter enzymes. These results bear on the control of cell proliferation.",

    "synopsis": "We propose an integrated computational model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls the dynamics of the mammalian cell cycle. The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, and protein synthesis or degradation. Growth factors (GFs) trigger the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D/Cdk4-6 in G(1), cyclin E/Cdk2 at the G(1)/S transition, cyclin A/Cdk2 in S and at the S/G(2) transition, and cyclin B/Cdk1 at the G(2)/M transition. The model accounts for the following major properties of the mammalian cell cycle: (i) repetitive cell cycling in the presence of suprathreshold amounts of GF; (ii) control of cell-cycle progression by the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the transcription factor E2F; and (iii) existence of a restriction point in G(1), beyond which completion of the cell cycle becomes independent of GF. The model also accounts for endoreplication. Incorporating the DNA replication checkpoint mediated by kinases ATR and Chk1 slows down the dynamics of the cell cycle without altering its oscillatory nature and leads to better separation of the S and M phases. The model for the mammalian cell cycle shows how the regulatory structure of the Cdk network results in its temporal self-organization, leading to the repetitive, sequential activation of the four Cdk modules that brings about the orderly progression along cell-cycle phases.",

The equations and parameters of the model are based on experimental and clinical results from published studies. The model includes the primary cell populations involved in effector T-cell mediated tumor killing: regulatory T cells, helper T cells, and dendritic cells. A key feature is the inclusion of multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression through the main cytokines and growth factors mediating the interactions between the cell populations. Decreased access of effector cells to the tumor interior with increasing tumor size is accounted for. The model is applied to tumors with different growth rates and antigenicities to gauge the relative importance of various immunosuppressive mechanisms. The most important factors leading to tumor escape are TGF-\u03b2-induced immunosuppression, conversion of helper T cells into regulatory T cells, and the limitation of immune cell access to the full tumor at large tumor sizes. The results suggest that for a given tumor growth rate, there is an optimal antigenicity maximizing the response of the immune system. Further increases in antigenicity result in increased immunosuppression, and therefore a decrease in tumor killing rate. This result may have implications for immunotherapies which modulate the effective antigenicity. Simulation of dendritic cell therapy with the model suggests that for some tumors, there is an optimal dose of transfused dendritic cells.",

CD4+ T cells, the cells that orchestrate the immune response, use these cytokines as signaling mechanisms for immune-response stimulation as well as lymphocyte stimulation, growth, and differentiation. Because tumor cells begin as 'self', the immune system may not respond in an effective way to eradicate them. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy can potentially restore or enhance these effects. We illustrate through mathematical modeling the dynamics between tumor cells, immune-effector cells, and IL-2. These efforts are able to explain both short tumor oscillations in tumor sizes as well as long-term tumor relapse. We then explore the effects of adoptive cellular immunotherapy on the model and describe under what circumstances the tumor can be eliminated.",

One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.",

    "synopsis": "Iron is an essential element of most living organisms but is a dangerous substance when poorly liganded in solution. The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data.A model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments.These results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important.

    "synopsis": "Because understanding of the inventory, connectivity and dynamics of the components characterizing the process of coagulation is relatively mature, it has become an attractive target for physiochemical modeling. Such models can potentially improve the design of therapeutics. The prothrombinase complex (composed of the protease factor (F)Xa and its cofactor FVa) plays a central role in this network as the main producer of thrombin, which catalyses both the activation of platelets and the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the main substances of a clot. A key negative feedback loop that prevents clot propagation beyond the site of injury is the thrombin-dependent generation of activated protein C (APC), an enzyme that inactivates FVa, thus neutralizing the prothrombinase complex. APC inactivation of FVa is complex, involving the production of partially active intermediates and \"protection\" of FVa from APC by both FXa and prothrombin. An empirically validated mathematical model of this process would be useful in advancing the predictive capacity of comprehensive models of coagulation.A model of human APC inactivation of prothrombinase was constructed in a stepwise fashion by analyzing time courses of FVa inactivation in empirical reaction systems with increasing number of interacting components and generating corresponding model constructs of each reaction system. Reaction mechanisms, rate constants and equilibrium constants informing these model constructs were initially derived from various research groups reporting on APC inactivation of FVa in isolation, or in the presence of FXa or prothrombin. Model predictions were assessed against empirical data measuring the appearance and disappearance of multiple FVa degradation intermediates as well as prothrombinase activity changes, with plasma proteins derived from multiple preparations. Our work integrates previously published findings and through the cooperative analysis of in vitro experiments and mathematical constructs we are able to produce a final validated model that includes 24 chemical reactions and interactions with 14 unique rate constants which describe the flux in concentrations of 24 species.This study highlights the complexity of the inactivation process and provides a module of equations describing the Protein C pathway that can be integrated into existing comprehensive mathematical models describing tissue factor initiated coagulation.",

    "synopsis": "Analysis of complex time-dependent biological networks is an important challenge in the current postgenomic era. We propose a middle-out approach for decomposition and analysis of complex time-dependent biological networks based on: 1), creation of a detailed mechanism-driven mathematical model of the network; 2), network response decomposition into several physiologically relevant subtasks; and 3), subsequent decomposition of the model, with the help of task-oriented necessity and sensitivity analysis into several modules that each control a single specific subtask, which is followed by further simplification employing temporal hierarchy reduction. The technique is tested and illustrated by studying blood coagulation. Five subtasks (threshold, triggering, control by blood flow velocity, spatial propagation, and localization), together with responsible modules, can be identified for the coagulation network. We show that the task of coagulation triggering is completely regulated by a two-step pathway containing a single positive feedback of factor V activation by thrombin. These theoretical predictions are experimentally confirmed by studies of fibrin generation in normal, factor V-, and factor VIII-deficient plasmas. The function of the factor V-dependent feedback is to minimize temporal and parametrical intervals of fibrin clot instability. We speculate that this pathway serves to lessen possibility of fibrin clot disruption by flow and subsequent thromboembolism.",

    "synopsis": "Background: Early cancer diagnosis is one of the most important challenges of cancer research, since in many can- cers it can lead to cure for patients with early stage diseases. For epithelial ovarian cancer (which is the leading cause of death among gynaecologic malignancies) the classical detection approach is based on measurements of CA-125 biomarker. However, the poor sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker impacts the detection of early-stage cancers.\r\nMethods: Here we use a computational approach to investigate the effect of combining multiple biomarkers for ovarian cancer (e.g., CA-125 and IL-7), to improve early cancer detection.\r\nResults: We show that this combined biomarkers approach could lead indeed to earlier cancer detection. However, the immune response (which influences the level of secreted IL-7 biomarker) plays an important role in improving and/or delaying cancer detection. Moreover, the detection level of IL-7 immune biomarker could be in a range that would not allow to distinguish between a healthy state and a cancerous state. In this case, the construction of solu- tion diagrams in the space generated by the IL-7 and CA-125 biomarkers could allow us predict the long-term evolu- tion of cancer biomarkers, thus allowing us to make predictions on cancer detection times.\r\nConclusions: Combining cancer and immune biomarkers could improve cancer detection times, and any predic- tions that could be made (at least through the use of CA-125/IL-7 biomarkers) are patient specific.\r\nKeywords: Ovarian cancer, Mathematical model, CA-125 biomarker, IL-7 biomarker, Cancer detection times",

    "synopsis": "Cancer immunotherapies rely on how interactions between cancer and immune system cells are constituted. The more essential to the emergence of the dynamical behavior of cancer growth these are, the more effectively they may be used as mechanisms for interventions. Mathematical modeling can help unearth such connections, and help explain how they shape the dynamics of cancer growth. Here, we explored whether there exist simple, consistent properties of cancer-immune system interaction (CISI) models that might be harnessed to devise effective immunotherapy approaches. We did this for a family of three related models of increasing complexity. To this end, we developed a base model of CISI, which captures some essential features of the more complex models built on it. We find that the base model and its derivates can reproduce biologically plausible behavior. This behavior is consistent with situations in which the suppressive effects exerted by cancer cells on immune cells dominate their proliferative effects. Under these circumstances, the model family may display a pattern of bistability, where two distinct, stable states (a cancer-free, and a full-grown cancer state) are possible, consistent with the notion of an immunological barrier. Increasing the effectiveness of immune-caused cancer cell killing may remove the basis for bistability, and abruptly tip the dynamics of the system into cancer-free state. In combination with the administration of immune effector cells, modifications in cancer cell killing may also be harnessed for immunotherapy without resolving the bistability. We use these ideas to test immunotherapeutic interventions in silico in a stochastic version of the base model. This bistability-reliant approach to cancer interventions might offer advantages over those that comprise gradual declines in cancer cell numbers.",

The model is first validated using the survival data of two clinical trials. Local sen- sitivity analysis of the parameters indicates there exists a critical activation rate of pro-tumor cytokines beyond which the cancer can be eradicated if four adoptive trans- fers of immune cells are applied. Optimal control theory is explored as a potential tool for searching the best adoptive cellular immunotherapies. Combined immunother- apies between adoptive ex vivo expanded immune cells and TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by siRNA treatments are investigated. This study concludes that mono-immunotherapy is unlikely to control the pancreatic cancer and combined immunotherapies between anti-TGF-\u03b2 and adoptive transfers of immune cells can prolong patient survival. We show through numerical explorations that how these two types of immunotherapies are scheduled is important to survival. Applying TGF-\u03b2 inhibition first followed by adoptive immune cell transfers can yield better survival outcomes.",

A system of coupled, ordinary differential equations was constructed to describe the temporal changes in tumour growth, along with intratumoural changes in the immune response, vascularity, necrosis and hypoxia. The mathematical model is calibrated with serially acquired experimental data of tumour volume, vascularity, necrosis and hypoxia obtained from either imaging or histology from a murine model of HER2+ breast cancer. Sensitivity analysis shows that model components are sensitive for 12 of 13 parameters, but accounting for uncertainty in the parameter values, model simulations still agree with the experimental data. Given theinitial conditions, the mathematical model predicts an increase in the immune infiltrates over time in the treated animals. Immunofluorescent staining results are presented that validate this prediction by showing an increased co-staining of CD11c and F4/80 (proteins expressed by dendritic cells and/or macrophages) in the total tissue for the treated tumours compared to the controls. We posit that the proposed mathematical\u2013experimental approach can be used to elucidate driving interactions between the trastuzumab-induced responses in the tumour and the immune system that drive the stabilization of vasculature while simultaneously decreasing tumour growth\u2014conclusions revealed by the mathematical model that were not deducible from the experimental data alone.",

Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) are some of the examples of immune suppressors/checkpoints. They are responsible for deactivating the immune system and enhancing immunological tolerance. Moreover, they categorically downregulate and suppress the immune system by preventing and blocking the activation of T-cells, which in turn decreases autoimmunity and enhances self-tolerance. In cancer immunotherapy, the immune checkpoints/suppressors prevent and block the immune cells from attacking, spreading, and killing the cancer cells, which leads to cancer growth and development. We formulate a mathematical model that studies three possible dynamics of the treatment and establish the effects of the immune checkpoints on the immune system and the treatment at large. Although the effect cannot be seen explicitly in the analysis of the model, we show it by numerical simulations.",

Numerical simulation demonstrated a stronger inhibition of thrombin generation by a thrombin inhibitor than a fXa inhibitor, but both prolonged clot time to a similar extent when they were given an equal dissociation constant (30 nm) for interaction with their respective target enzymes. These differences were then tested by comparison with the real inhibitors DX-9065a and argatroban, specific competitive inhibitors of fXa and thrombin, respectively, with similar K(i) values. Comparisons were made in extrinsically triggered human citrated plasma, for which endogenous thrombin potential and clot formation were simultaneously measured with a Wallac multilabel counter equipped with both fluorometric and photometric detectors and a fluorogenic reporter substrate. The results demonstrated stronger inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential by argatroban than by DX-9065a, especially when coagulation was initiated at higher tissue factor concentrations, while argatroban appeared to be slightly less potent in its ability to prolong clot time. This study demonstrates differential inhibition of thrombin generation by fXa and thrombin inhibitors and has implications for the pharmacological regulation of blood coagulation by the anticoagulant protease inhibitors.",

A similar but far less studied process occurs in relation to the nervous system and is referred to as neoneurogenesis. The relationship between tumour progression and the nervous system is still poorly understood and is likely to involve a multitude of factors. It is therefore relevant to study tumour-nerve interactions through mathematical modelling: this may reveal the most significant factors of the plethora of interacting elements regulating neoneurogenesis. The present work is a first attempt to model the neurobiological aspect of cancer development through a system of differential equations. The model confirms the experimental observations that a tumour is able to promote nerve formation/elongation around itself, and that high levels of nerve growth factor and axon guidance molecules are recorded in the presence of a tumour. Our results also reflect the observation that high stress levels (represented by higher norepinephrine release by sympathetic nerves) contribute to tumour development and spread, indicating a mutually beneficial relationship between tumour cells and neurons. The model predictions suggest novel therapeutic strategies, aimed at blocking the stress effects on tumour growth and dissemination.",

    "synopsis": "Mathematical modeling of thrombosis typically involves modeling the coagulation cascade. Models of coagulation generally involve the reaction kinetics for dozens of proteins. The resulting system of equations is difficult to parameterize and its numerical solution is challenging when coupled to blood flow or other physics important to clotting. Prior research suggests that essential aspects of coagulation may be reproduced by simpler models. This evidence motivates a systematic approach to model reduction. We herein introduce an automated framework to generate reduced-order models of blood coagulation. The framework consists of nested optimizations, where an outer optimization selects the optimal species for the reduced-order model and an inner optimization selects the optimal reaction rates for the new coagulation network. The framework was tested on an established 34-species coagulation model to rigorously consider what level of model fidelity is necessary to capture essential coagulation dynamics. The results indicate that a nine-species reduced-order model is sufficient to reproduce the thrombin dynamics of the benchmark 34-species model for a range of tissue factor concentrations, including those not included in the optimization process. Further model reduction begins to compromise the ability to capture the thrombin generation process. The framework proposed herein enables automated development of reduced-order models of coagulation that maintain essential dynamics used to model thrombosis.",

    "synopsis": "Despite improvements in cancer therapy and treatments, tumor recurrence is a common event in cancer patients. One explanation of recurrence is that cancer therapy focuses on treatment of tumor cells and does not eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are postulated to behave similar to normal stem cells in that their role is to maintain homeostasis. That is, when the population of tumor cells is reduced or depleted by treatment, CSCs will repopulate the tumor, causing recurrence. In this paper, we study the application of the CSC Hypothesis to the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme by immunotherapy. We extend the work of Kogan et al. (2008) to incorporate the dynamics of CSCs, prove the existence of a recurrence state, and provide an analysis of possible cancerous states and their dependence on treatment levels.",

    "synopsis": "The objective of this study was to create a clinically applicable mathematical model of immunotherapy for cancer and use it to explore differences between successful and unsuccessful treatment scenarios. The simplified predator-prey model includes four lumped parameters: tumor growth rate, g; immune cell killing efficiency, k; immune cell signaling factor, \u03bb; and immune cell half-life decay, \u03bc. The predator-prey equations as functions of time, t, for normalized tumor cell numbers, y, (the prey) and immunocyte numbers, \u00d7, (the predators) are: dy/dt = gy - kx and dx/dt = \u03bbxy - \u03bcx. A parameter estimation procedure that capitalizes on available clinical data and the timing of clinically observable phenomena gives mid-range benchmarks for parameters representing the unstable equilibrium case in which the tumor neither grows nor shrinks. Departure from this equilibrium results in oscillations in tumor cell numbers and in many cases complete elimination of the tumor. Several paradoxical phenomena are predicted, including increasing tumor cell numbers prior to a population crash, apparent cure with late recurrence, one or more cycles of tumor growth prior to eventual tumor elimination, and improved tumor killing with initially weaker immune parameters or smaller initial populations of immune cells. The model and the parameter estimation techniques are easily adapted to various human cancers that evoke an immune response. They may help clinicians understand and predict certain strange and unexpected effects in the world of tumor immunity and lead to the design of clinical trials to test improved treatment protocols for patients.",

However, it is still unknown how these immune cells interact with each other to control tumour dynamics. Here, we use a mathematical model for the interactions between mouse melanoma cells, Th2/Th1 cells and M2/M1 macrophages, to investigate the unknown role of the re-polarisation between M1 and M2 macrophages on tumour growth. The results show that tumour growth is associated with a type-II immune response described by large numbers of Th2 and M2 cells. Moreover, we show that (i) the ratio k of the transition rates k12 (for the re-polarisation M1\u2192M2) and k21 (for the re-polarisation M2\u2192M1) is important in reducing tumour population, and (ii) the particular values of these transition rates control the delay in tumour growth and the final tumour size. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of various model parameters on changes in the tumour cell population, and confirm that the ratio k alone and the ratio of M2 and M1 macrophage populations at earlier times (e.g., day 7) cannot always predict the final tumour size.",

We then add the effects of a simple immune system, and both immune-suppression factors and immuno-chemotherapeutic agents as well.

    "synopsis": "The newly characterized interleukin (IL)-21 plays a central role in the transition from innate immunity to adaptive immunity and shows substantial tumor regression in mice. IL-21 is now developed as a cancer immunotherapeutic drug, but conditions for efficacious therapy, and the conflicting immunostimulatory and immunoinhibitory influence of the cytokine, are yet to be defined. We studied the effects of IL-21 on tumor eradication in a mathematical model focusing on natural killer (NK) cell-mediated and CD8+ T-cell-mediated lysis of tumor cells. Model parameters were estimated using results in tumor-bearing mice treated with IL-21 via cytokine gene therapy (CGT), hydrodynamics-based gene delivery (HGD), or standard interval dosing (SID). Our model accurately retrieved experimental growth dynamics in the nonimmunogenic B16 melanoma and the immunogenic MethA and MCA205 fibrosarcomas, showing a strong dependence of the NK-cell/CD8+ T-cell balance on tumor immunogenicity. Moreover, in melanoma, simulations of CGT-like dosing regimens, dynamically determined according to tumor mass changes, resulted in efficient disease elimination. In contrast, in fibrosarcoma, such a strategy was not superior to that of fixed dosing regimens, HGD or SID. Our model supports clinical use of IL-21 as a potent stimulator of cellular immunity against cancer, and suggests selecting the immunotherapy strategy according to tumor immunogenicity. Nonimmunogenic tumors, but not highly immunogenic tumors, should be controlled by IL-21 dosing, which depends on tumor mass at the time of administration. This method imitates, yet amplifies, the natural anticancer immune response rather than accelerates only one of the response arms in an unbalanced manner.",

By comparing the model with experimental data, numerical estimates of parameters describing processes that cannot be measured in vivo are derived.

Through a combination of analytical studies and numerical simulations, our model exemplifies the three Es of immunoediting: elimination, equilibrium and escape. Specifically, it reveals that the three Es of immunoediting depend highly on the infiltration rates of the helper and cytotoxic T cells. The model\u2019s results indicate that both the helper and cytotoxic T cells play a key role in tumour elimination.

Analysis of the model is carried out for each of the three drug infusion methods. Analytic solutions are determined where possible and stability analysis of both steady state solutions for the ODEs and DDEs is presented. The results indicate that constant and periodic drug infusion methods are more efficient compared to a single bolus injection. Numerical simulations show that with a large virus burst size, irrespective of the drug infusion method, chemovirotherapy is highly effective compared to either treatments. The simulations further show that both delays increase the period within which a tumor can be cleared from body tissue.",

Computer simulations of the equilibrium model were carried out to generate plasma concentration-time profiles resulting from a large range of intravenous bolus doses. Additionally, the final model was fitted to previously published pharmacokinetic profiles of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that seems to exhibit TMDD, following intravenous administration of 12.5, 25, 100, 250, 500, or 750 microg/kg in sheep.Simulations show that pharmacokinetic profiles display steeper distribution phases for lower doses and similar terminal disposition phases, but with slight underestimation at early time points as theoretically expected. The final model well-described LIF pharmacokinetics, and the final parameters, which were estimated with relatively good precision, were in good agreement with literature values.An equilibrium model of TMDD is developed that recapitulates the essential features of the full general model and eliminates the need for estimating drug-binding microconstants that are often difficult or impossible to identify from typical in vivo pharmacokinetic data.",

These results are surprising because CD4(+) Th1 cells are typically considered to be capable of tumor rejection. We used mathematical models to investigate this unexpected outcome. We found that neither CD4(+) Th1 nor CD4(+) Th2 cells could eliminate the cancer cells when acting alone, but that tumor elimination could be induced by recruitment of eosinophils by the Th2 cells. These recruited eosinophils had unexpected indirect effects on the decay rate of type 2 cytokines and the rate at which Th2 cells are inactivated through interactions with cancer cells. Strikingly, the presence of eosinophils impacted tumor growth more significantly than the release of tumor-suppressing cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Our simulations suggest that novel strategies to enhance eosinophil recruitment into skin tumors may improve cancer immunotherapies.",

    "synopsis": "It is generally accepted that tumour cells can be eliminated by M1 anti-tumour macrophages and CD8+ T cells. However, experimental results over the past 10-15 years have shown that B16 mouse melanoma cells can be eliminated by the CD4+ T cells alone (either Th1 or Th2 sub-types), in the absence of CD8+ T cells. In some studies, elimination of B16 melanoma was associated with a Th1 immune response (i.e., elimination occurred in the presence of cytokines produced by Th1 cells), while in other studies melanoma elimination was associated with a Th2 immune response (i.e., elimination occurred in the presence of cytokines produced by Th2 cells). Moreover, macrophages have been shown to be present inside the tumours, during both Th1 and Th2 immune responses. To investigate the possible biological mechanisms behind these apparently contradictory results, we develop a class of mathematical models for the dynamics of Th1 and Th2 cells, and M1 and M2 macrophages in the presence/absence of tumour cells. Using this mathematical model, we show that depending on the re-polarisation rates between M1 and M2 macrophages, we obtain tumour elimination in the presence of a type-I immune response (i.e., more Th1 and M1 cells, compared to the Th2 and M2 cells), or in the presence of a type-II immune response (i.e., more Th2 and M2 cells). Moreover, tumour elimination is also possible in the presence of a mixed type-I/type-II immune response. Tumour growth always occurs in the presence of a type-II immune response, as observed experimentally. Finally, tumour dormancy is the result of a delicate balance between the pro-tumour effects of M2 cells and the anti-tumour effects of M1 and Th1 cells.",

    "synopsis": "It is generally accepted that tumour cells can be eliminated by M1 anti-tumour macrophages and CD8+ T cells. However, experimental results over the past 10-15 years have shown that B16 mouse melanoma cells can be eliminated by the CD4+ T cells alone (either Th1 or Th2 sub-types), in the absence of CD8+ T cells. In some studies, elimination of B16 melanoma was associated with a Th1 immune response (i.e., elimination occurred in the presence of cytokines produced by Th1 cells), while in other studies melanoma elimination was associated with a Th2 immune response (i.e., elimination occurred in the presence of cytokines produced by Th2 cells). Moreover, macrophages have been shown to be present inside the tumours, during both Th1 and Th2 immune responses. To investigate the possible biological mechanisms behind these apparently contradictory results, we develop a class of mathematical models for the dynamics of Th1 and Th2 cells, and M1 and M2 macrophages in the presence/absence of tumour cells. Using this mathematical model, we show that depending on the re-polarisation rates between M1 and M2 macrophages, we obtain tumour elimination in the presence of a type-I immune response (i.e., more Th1 and M1 cells, compared to the Th2 and M2 cells), or in the presence of a type-II immune response (i.e., more Th2 and M2 cells). Moreover, tumour elimination is also possible in the presence of a mixed type-I/type-II immune response. Tumour growth always occurs in the presence of a type-II immune response, as observed experimentally. Finally, tumour dormancy is the result of a delicate balance between the pro-tumour effects of M2 cells and the anti-tumour effects of M1 and Th1 cells.",

    "synopsis": "The Edmonston vaccine strain of measles virus has potent and selective activity against a wide range of tumors. Tumor cells infected by this virus or genetically modified strains express viral proteins that allow them to fuse with neighboring cells to form syncytia that ultimately die. Moreover, infected cells may produce new virus particles that proceed to infect additional tumor cells. We present a model of tumor and virus interactions based on established biology and with proper accounting of the free virus population. The range of model parameters is estimated by fitting to available experimental data. The stability of equilibrium states corresponding to complete tumor eradication, therapy failure and partial tumor reduction is discussed. We use numerical simulations to explore conditions for which the model predicts successful therapy and tumor eradication. The model exhibits damped, as well as stable oscillations in a range of parameter values. These oscillatory states are organized by a Hopf bifurcation.",

    "synopsis": "Oncolytic virotherapy is an emerging treatment modality which uses replication-competent viruses to destroy cancers without causing harm to normal tissues. By the development of molecular biotechnology, many effective viruses are adapted or engineered to make them cancer-specific, such as measles, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus and M1 virus. A successful design of virus needs a full understanding about how viral and host parameters influence the tumor load. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model on the oncolytic virotherapy incorporating viral lytic cycle and virus-specific CTL response. Thresholds for viral treatment and virus-specific CTL response are obtained. Different protocols are given depending on the thresholds. Our results also support that immune suppressive drug can enhance the oncolytic effect of virus as reported in recent literature.",

This paper analyses the effect of de-differentiation on the basic and evolutionary dynamics of cells in the context of tissue hierarchy models that include negative feedback regulation of the cell populations. The models predict that in the presence of de-differentiation, the fixation probability of a neutral mutant is lower than in its absence. Therefore, if de-differentiation occurs, a mutant with identical parameters compared to the wild-type cell population behaves like a disadvantageous mutant.

Chemotherapy protocol design is considered in this context using a simple, robust, model of advanced tumour growth with Gompertzian dynamics, taking into account the effects of drug resistance. It is predicted that reduced chemotherapy protocols can readily lead to improved survival times due to the effects of competition between resistant and sensitive tumour cells. Very early palliation is also predicted to quickly yield near total tumour resistance and thus decrease survival duration. Finally, our simulations indicate that failed curative attempts using dose densification, a common protocol escalation strategy, can reduce survival times.",

Mathematical analyses are performed to determine the threshold of a successful treatment. The interindividual variability is explored by one-, two-, and three-parameter bifurcation diagrams for a nontreatment case. Numerical simulation conducted in this paper shows that (i) the tumor can be regulated by administering CD4+ T cells alone in a patient with a strong immune system or who has been diagnosed at an early stage, (ii) immunotherapy with a large amount of an antitumor cytokine can boost the immune system to remit or even to suppress tumor cells completely, and (iii) through polytherapy the tumor can be kept at a smaller size with reduced dosages.",

    "synopsis": "One of the most challenging tasks in constructing a mathematical model of cancer treatment is the calculation of biological parameters from empirical data. This task becomes increasingly difficult if a model involves several cell populations and treatment modalities. A sophisticated model constructed by de Pillis et al., Mixed immunotherapy and chemotherapy of tumours: Modelling, applications and biological interpretations, J. Theor. Biol. 238 (2006), pp. 841-862; involves tumour cells, specific and non-specific immune cells (natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+T cells and other lymphocytes) and employs chemotherapy and two types of immunotherapy (IL-2 supplementation and CD8+T-cell infusion) as treatment modalities. Despite the overall success of the aforementioned model, the problem of illustrating the effects of IL-2 on a growing tumour remains open. In this paper, we update the model of de Pillis et al. and then carefully identify appropriate values for the parameters of the new model according to recent empirical data. We determine new NK and tumour antigen-activated CD8+T-cell count equilibrium values; we complete IL-2 dynamics; and we modify the model in de Pillis et al. to allow for endogenous IL-2 production, IL-2-stimulated NK cell proliferation and IL-2-dependent CD8+T-cell self-regulations. Finally, we show that the potential patient-specific efficacy of immunotherapy may be dependent on experimentally determinable parameters.",

In contrast, CD4+ T cells are commonly classified as helper T cells (HTCs) on the basis of their roles in providing help to the generation and maintenance of effective CD8+ cytotoxic and memory T cells. In order to get a better insight on the role of HTCs in a tumor immune system, we incorporate the third population of HTCs into a previous two dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) model. Further we introduce the adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI) as the treatment to boost the immune system to fight against tumors. Compared tumor cells (TCs) and effector cells (ECs), the recruitment of HTCs changes the dynamics of the system substantially, by the effects through particular parameters, i.e., the activation rate of ECs by HTCs, \u03c0 (scaled as \u03c0), and the HTCs stimulation rate by the presence of identified tumor antigens, k2 (scaled as \u03c52). We describe the stability regions of the interior equilibria \u00c9 (no treatment case) and E+ (treatment case) in the scaled (\u03c0,\u03c52) parameter space respectively. Both \u03c0 and \u03c52 can destabilize \u00c9 and E+ and cause Hopf bifurcations. Our results show that HTCs might play a crucial role in the long term periodic oscillation behaviors of tumor immune system interactions. They also show that TCs may be eradicated from the patient's body under the ACI treatment.",

    "synopsis": "The two-feedback-loop regulatory module of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway is modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. The constructed model involves two-compartment kinetics of the activators IkappaB (IKK) and NF-kappaB, the inhibitors A20 and IkappaBalpha, and their complexes. In resting cells, the unphosphorylated IkappaBalpha binds to NF-kappaB and sequesters it in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. In response to extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1, IKK is transformed from its neutral form (IKKn) into its active form (IKKa), a form capable of phosphorylating IkappaBalpha, leading to IkappaBalpha degradation. Degradation of IkappaBalpha releases the main activator NF-kappaB, which then enters the nucleus and triggers transcription of the inhibitors and numerous other genes. The newly synthesized IkappaBalpha leads NF-kappaB out of the nucleus and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, while A20 inhibits IKK converting IKKa into the inactive form (IKKi), a form different from IKKn, no longer capable of phosphorylating IkappaBalpha. After parameter fitting, the proposed model is able to properly reproduce time behavior of all variables for which the data are available: NF-kappaB, cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha, A20 and IkappaBalpha mRNA transcripts, IKK and IKK catalytic activity in both wild-type and A20-deficient cells. The model allows detailed analysis of kinetics of the involved proteins and their complexes and gives the predictions of the possible responses of whole kinetics to the change in the level of a given activator or inhibitor.",

The model accounts for biological and clinical factors which regulate the interaction rates of cytotoxic T lymphocytes on the surface of the tumour mass. A phase plane analysis demonstrates that competition between tumour cells and lymphocytes can result in tumour eradication, perpetual oscillations, or unbounded solutions. To investigate the dependence of the dynamic behaviour on model parameters, the equations are solved analytically and conditions for unbounded versus bounded solutions are discussed. An analytic characterisation of the basin of attraction for oscillatory orbits is given. It is also shown that the tumour shape, characterised by a surface area to volume scaling factor, influences the size of the basin, with significant consequences for therapy design. The findings reveal that the tumour volume must surpass a threshold size that depends on lymphocyte parameters for the cancer to be completely eliminated. A semi-analytic procedure to calculate oscillation periods and determine their sensitivity to model parameters is also presented. Numerical results show that the period of oscillations exhibits notable nonlinear dependence on biologically relevant conditions.",

These molecules have shown promise as immuno-oncology drugs, and the TC is considered the pharmacologically active species that drives their pharmacodynamic effect. Here, we have presented a general target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model for these BsAbs, which bind to two different targets on different cell membranes. The model includes four different binding events for BsAbs, turnover of the targets, and internalization of the complexes. In addition, a quasi-equilibrium (QE) approximation with decreased number of binding parameters and, if necessary, reduced internalization parameters is presented. The model is further used to investigate the kinetics of BsAb and TC concentrations. Our analysis shows that larger doses of BsAbs may delay the build-up of the TC. Consequently, a method to compute the optimal dosing strategy of BsAbs, which will immediately create and maintain maximal possible TC concentration, is presented.",

    "synopsis": "Oncolytic virotherapy is an experimental cancer treatment that uses genetically engineered viruses to target and kill cancer cells. One major limitation of this treatment is that virus particles are rapidly cleared by the immune system, preventing them from arriving at the tumour site. To improve virus survival and infectivity Kim et al. (Biomaterials 32(9):2314-2326, 2011) modified virus particles with the polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the monoclonal antibody herceptin. Whilst PEG modification appeared to improve plasma retention and initial infectivity, it also increased the virus particle arrival time. We derive a mathematical model that describes the interaction between tumour cells and an oncolytic virus. We tune our model to represent the experimental data by Kim et\u00a0al. (2011) and obtain optimised parameters. Our model provides a platform from which predictions may be made about the response of cancer growth to other treatment protocols beyond those in the experiments. Through model simulations, we find that the treatment protocol affects the outcome dramatically. We quantify the effects of dosage strategy as a function of tumour cell replication and tumour carrying capacity on the outcome of oncolytic virotherapy as a treatment. The relative significance of the modification of the virus and the crucial role it plays in optimising treatment efficacy are explored.",

In this paper, we propose a nonlinear mathematical model of cancer immunosurveillance that takes into account some of these features based on cell-mediated immune responses. The model describes phenomena that are seen in vivo, such as tumor dormancy, robustness, immunoselection over tumor heterogeneity (also called \"cancer immunoediting\") and strong sensitivity to initial conditions in the composition of tumor microenvironment. The results framework has as common element the tumor as an attractor for abnormal cells. Bifurcation analysis give us as tumor attractors fixed-points, limit cycles and chaotic attractors, the latter emerging from period-doubling cascade displaying Feigenbaum's universality.

We develop a mathematical model in order to gain insight into the cooperative interaction between anti-TGF-\u03b2 and vaccine treatments. The mathematical model follows the dynamics of the tumor size, TGF-\u03b2 concentration, activated cytotoxic effector cells, and regulatory T cells. Using numerical simulations and stability analysis, we study the following scenarios: a control case of no treatment, anti-TGF-\u03b2 treatment, vaccine treatment, and combined anti-TGF-\u03b2 vaccine treatments.

The model is first validated using the survival data of two clinical trials. Local sensitivity analysis of the parameters indicates there exists a critical activation rate of pro-tumor cytokines beyond which the cancer can be eradicated if four adoptive transfers of immune cells are applied. Optimal control theory is explored as a potential tool for searching the best adoptive cellular immunotherapies. Combined immunotherapies between adoptive ex vivo expanded immune cells and TGF-[Formula: see text] inhibition by siRNA treatments are investigated. This study concludes that mono-immunotherapy is unlikely to control the pancreatic cancer and combined immunotherapies between anti-TGF-[Formula: see text] and adoptive transfers of immune cells can prolong patient survival. We show through numerical explorations that how these two types of immunotherapies are scheduled is important to survival. Applying TGF-[Formula: see text] inhibition first followed by adoptive immune cell transfers can yield better survival outcomes.",

    "synopsis": "The canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway regulates central processes in mammalian cells and plays a fundamental role in the regulation of inflammation and immunity. Aberrant regulation of the activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB is associated with severe diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. In the canonical pathway, the inhibitor I\u03baB suppresses NF-\u03baB's transcriptional activity. NF-\u03baB becomes active upon the degradation of I\u03baB, a process that is, in turn, regulated by the \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein (\u03b2-TrCP). \u03b2-TrCP has therefore been proposed as a promising pharmacological target in the development of novel therapeutic approaches to control NF-\u03baB's activity in diseases. This study explores the extent to which \u03b2-TrCP affects the dynamics of nuclear NF-\u03baB using a computational model of canonical NF-\u03baB signaling. The analysis predicts that \u03b2-TrCP influences the steady-state concentration of nuclear NF-\u03baB, as well as changes characteristic dynamic properties of nuclear NF-\u03baB, such as fold-change and the duration of its response to pathway stimulation. The results suggest that the modulation of \u03b2-TrCP has a high potential to regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: Cancer arises when within a single cell multiple malfunctions of control systems occur, which are, broadly, the system that promote cell growth and the system that protect against erratic growth. Additional systems within the cell must be corrupted so that a cancer cell, to form a mass of any real size, produces substances that promote the growth of new blood vessels. Multiple mutations are required before a normal cell can become a cancer cell by corruption of multiple growth-promoting systems. METHODS: We develop a simple mathematical model to describe the solid cancer growth dynamics inducing angiogenesis in the absence of cancer controlling mechanisms. RESULTS: The initial conditions supplied to the dynamical system consist of a perturbation in form of pulse: The origin of cancer cells from normal cells of an organ of human body. Thresholds of interacting parameters were obtained from the steady states analysis. The existence of two equilibrium points determine the strong dependency of dynamical trajectories on the initial conditions. The thresholds can be used to control cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer can be settled in an organ if the following combination matches: better fitness of cancer cells, decrease in the efficiency of the repairing systems, increase in the capacity of sprouting from existing vascularization, and higher capacity of mounting up new vascularization. However, we show that cancer is rarely induced in organs (or tissues) displaying an efficient (numerically and functionally) reparative or regenerative mechanism.",

Cancer cells can be eradicated if the tumor has a small growth rate and is also not competitive. Treatments by either CD4+, cytokines, or a combination of the two are applied to study their effectiveness. It is concluded that doses of treatments along with the tumor size are critical in determining the fate of the tumor. Tumor cells can be eliminated completely if doses of treatments by cytokine are large. The treatments are in general more effective if the tumor size is smaller.

AML is routinely treated with chemotherapy, and so it is of great interest to develop optimal chemotherapy treatment strategies. In this work, we incorporate an immune response into a stem cell model of AML, since we find that previous models lacking an immune response are inappropriate for deriving optimal control strategies. Using optimal control theory, we produce continuous controls and bang-bang controls, corresponding to a range of objectives and parameter choices. Through example calculations, we provide a practical approach to applying optimal control using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. In particular, we describe and explore factors that have a profound influence on numerical convergence. We find that the convergence behaviour is sensitive to the method of control updating, the nature of the control, and to the relative weighting of terms in the objective function.

Haematopoiesis can be seen as an evolutionary tree, starting with one cell that undergoes several divisions during the expansion phase, afterwards losing functional cells during the aging-related contraction phase. During divisions, offspring cells acquire variations, which can be either normal or abnormal. If an abnormal variation is present in more than 25% of the final cells, a monoclonal, leukemic pattern occurs. Such a pattern develops if: (A1) The abnormal variation occurs early, during the first or second divisions; (A2) The variation confers exceptional proliferative capacity; (B) A sizable proportion of the normal clones are destroyed and a previously non-significant abnormal clone gains relative dominance over a depleted environment; (C) The abnormal variation confers relative immortality, rendering it significant during the contraction phase. Combinations of these pathways further enhance the leukemic risk of the system. A simple mathematical model is used in order to characterize normal and leukemic states and to explain the above cellular processes generating monoclonal leukemic patterns.",

Blood-based biomarkers for glioma are needed for more accurate evaluation of treatment response as well as early diagnosis. However, biomarker research in primary brain tumors is challenging given their relative rarity and genetic diversity. It is further complicated by variations in the permeability of the blood brain barrier that affects the amount of marker released into the bloodstream. Inspired by recent temporal data indicating a possible decrease in serum glucose levels in patients with gliomas yet to be diagnosed, we present an ordinary differential equation model to capture early stage glioma growth. The model contains glioma-glucose-immune interactions and poses a potential mechanism by which this glucose drop can be explained.

    "synopsis": "Immunotherapies exploit the immune system to target and kill cancer cells, while sparing healthy tissue. Antibody therapies, an important class of immunotherapies, involve the binding to specific antigens on the surface of the tumour cells of antibodies that activate natural killer (NK) cells to kill the tumour cells. Preclinical assessment of molecules that may cause antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) involves co-culturing cancer cells, NK cells and antibody in vitro for several hours and measuring subsequent levels of tumour cell lysis. Here we develop a mathematical model of such an in vitro ADCC assay, formulated as a system of time-dependent ordinary differential equations and in which NK cells kill cancer cells at a rate which depends on the amount of antibody bound to each cancer cell. Numerical simulations generated using experimentally-based parameter estimates reveal that the system evolves on two timescales: a fast timescale on which antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of the tumour cells, and NK cells form complexes with the cancer cells, and a longer time-scale on which the NK cells kill the cancer cells. We construct approximate model solutions on each timescale, and show that they are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results show how the processes involved in ADCC change as the initial concentration of antibody and NK-cancer cell ratio are varied. We use these results to explain what information about the tumour cell kill rate can be extracted from the cytotoxicity assays.",

    "synopsis": "Interleukin-7 (IL7) plays a nonredundant role in T cell survival and homeostasis, which is illustrated in the severe T cell lymphopenia of IL7-deficient mice, or demonstrated in animals or humans that lack expression of either the IL7R\u03b1 or \u03b3 c chain, the two subunits that constitute the functional IL7 receptor. Remarkably, IL7 is not expressed by T cells themselves, but produced in limited amounts by radio-resistant stromal cells. Thus, T cells need to constantly compete for IL7 to survive. How T cells maintain homeostasis and further maximize the size of the peripheral T cell pool in face of such competition are important questions that have fascinated both immunologists and mathematicians for a long time. Exceptionally, IL7 downregulates expression of its own receptor, so that IL7-signaled T cells do not consume extracellular IL7, and thus, the remaining extracellular IL7 can be shared among unsignaled T cells. Such an altruistic behavior of the IL7R\u03b1 chain is quite unique among members of the \u03b3 c cytokine receptor family. However, the consequences of this altruistic signaling behavior at the molecular, single cell and population levels are less well understood and require further investigation. In this regard, mathematical modeling of how a limited resource can be shared, while maintaining the clonal diversity of the T cell pool, can help decipher the molecular or cellular mechanisms that regulate T cell homeostasis. Thus, the current review aims to provide a mathematical modeling perspective of IL7-dependent T cell homeostasis at the molecular, cellular and population levels, in the context of recent advances in our understanding of the IL7 biology.

    "synopsis": "In Multiple Myeloma Bone Disease healthy bone remodelling is affected by tumour cells by means of paracrine cytokinetic signalling in such a way that osteoclast formation is enhanced and the growth of osteoblast cells inhibited. The participating cytokines are described in the literature. Osteoclast-induced myeloma cell growth is also reported. Based on existing mathematical models for healthy bone remodelling a three-way equilibrium model is presented for osteoclasts, osteoblasts and myeloma cell populations to describe the progress of the illness in a scenario in which there is a secular increase in the cytokinetic interactive effectiveness of paracrine processes. The equilibrium state for the system is obtained. The paracrine interactive effectiveness is explored by parameter variation and the stable region in the parameter space is identified. Then recently-discovered joint myeloma-osteoclast cells are added to the model to describe the populations inside lytic lesions. It transpires that their presence expands the available parameter space for stable equilibrium, thus permitting a detrimental, larger population of osteoclasts and myeloma cells. A possible relapse mechanism for the illness is explored by letting joint cells dissociate. The mathematics then permits the evaluation of the evolution of the cell populations as a function of time during relapse.",

    "synopsis": "Non-invasive measurements of pH have shown that both tumour and normal cells have intracellular pH (pHi) that lies on the alkaline side of neutrality (7.1-7.2). However, extracellular pH (pHe) is reported to be more acidic in some tumours compared to normal tissues. Many cellular processes and therapeutic agents are known to be tightly pH dependent which makes the study of intracellular pH regulation of paramount importance. We develop a mathematical model that examines the role of various membrane-based ion transporters in tumour pH regulation, in particular, with a focus on the interplay between lactate and H(+) ions and whether the lactate/H(+) symporter activity is sufficient to give rise to the observed reversed pH gradient that is seen is some tumours. Using linear stability analysis and numerical methods, we are able to gain a clear understanding of the relationship between lactate and H(+) ions. We extend this analysis using perturbation techniques to specifically examine a rapid change in H(+)-ion concentrations relative to variations in lactate. We then perform a parameter sensitivity analysis to explore solution robustness to parameter variations. An important result from our study is that a reversed pH gradient is possible in our system but for unrealistic parameter estimates-pointing to the possible involvement of other mechanisms in cellular pH gradient reversal, for example acidic vesicles, lysosomes, golgi and endosomes.",

    "synopsis": "Over the last few years, oncolytic virus therapy has been recognised as a promising approach in cancer treatment, due to the potential of these viruses to induce systemic anti-tumour immunity and selectively killing tumour cells. However, the effectiveness of these viruses depends significantly on their interactions with the host immune responses, both innate (e.g., macrophages, which accumulate in high numbers inside solid tumours) and adaptive (e.g., [Formula: see text] T cells). In this article, we consider a mathematical approach to investigate the possible outcomes of the complex interactions between two extreme types of macrophages (M1 and M2 cells), effector [Formula: see text] T cells and an oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), on the growth/elimination of B16F10 melanoma. We discuss, in terms of VSV, [Formula: see text] and macrophages levels, two different types of immune responses which could ensure tumour control and eventual elimination. We show that both innate and adaptive anti-tumour immune responses, as well as the oncolytic virus, could be very important in delaying tumour relapse and eventually eliminating the tumour. Overall this study supports the use mathematical modelling to increase our understanding of the complex immune interaction following oncolytic virotherapies. However, the complexity of the model combined with a lack of sufficient data for model parametrisation has an impact on the possibility of making quantitative predictions.",

    "synopsis": "Tumorigenesis has been described as a multistep process, where each step is associated with a genetic alteration, in the direction to progressively transform a normal cell and its descendants into a malignant tumour. Into this work, we propose a mathematical model for cancer onset and development, considering three populations: normal, premalignant and cancer cells. The model takes into account three hallmarks of cancer: self-sufficiency on growth signals, insensibility to anti-growth signals and evading apoptosis. By using a nonlinear expression to describe the mutation from premalignant to cancer cells, the model includes genetic instability as an enabling characteristic of tumour progression. Mathematical analysis was performed in detail. Results indicate that apoptosis and tissue repair system are the first barriers against tumour progression. One of these mechanisms must be corrupted for cancer to develop from a single mutant cell. The results also show that the presence of aggressive cancer cells opens way to survival of less adapted premalignant cells. Numerical simulations were performed with parameter values based on experimental data of breast cancer, and the necessary time taken for cancer to reach a detectable size from a single mutant cell was estimated with respect to some parameters. We find that the rates of apoptosis and mutations have a large influence on the pace of tumour progression and on the time it takes to become clinically detectable.",

    "synopsis": "Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive (WHO grade IV) primary brain tumor, is refractory to traditional treatments, such as surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. This study aims at aiding in the design of more efficacious GBM therapies. We constructed a mathematical model for glioma and the immune system interactions, that may ensue upon direct intra-tumoral administration of ex vivo activated alloreactive cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes (aCTL). Our model encompasses considerations of the interactive dynamics of aCTL, tumor cells, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II molecules, as well as cytokines, such as TGF-beta and IFN-gamma, which dampen or increase the pro-inflammatory environment, respectively. Computer simulations were used for model verification and for retrieving putative treatment scenarios. The mathematical model successfully retrieved clinical trial results of efficacious aCTL immunotherapy for recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III). It predicted that cellular adoptive immunotherapy failed in GBM because the administered dose was 20-fold lower than required for therapeutic efficacy. Model analysis suggests that GBM may be eradicated by new dose-intensive strategies, e.g., 3 x 10(8) aCTL every 4 days for small tumor burden, or 2 x 10(9) aCTL, infused every 5 days for larger tumor burden. Further analysis pinpoints crucial bio-markers relating to tumor growth rate, tumor size, and tumor sensitivity to the immune system, whose estimation enables regimen personalization. We propose that adoptive cellular immunotherapy was prematurely abandoned. It may prove efficacious for GBM, if dose intensity is augmented, as prescribed by the mathematical model. Re-initiation of clinical trials, using calculated individualized regimens for grade III-IV malignant glioma, is suggested.",

    "synopsis": "The tumor microenvironment comprising of the immune cells and cytokines acts as the 'soil' that nourishes a developing tumor. Lack of a comprehensive study of the interactions of this tumor microenvironment with the heterogeneous sub-population of tumor cells that arise from the differentiation of Cancer Stem Cells (CSC), i.e. the 'seed', has limited our understanding of the development of drug resistance and treatment failures in Cancer. Based on this seed and soil hypothesis, for the very first time, we have captured the concept of CSC differentiation and tumor-immune interaction into a generic model that has been validated with known experimental data. Using this model we report that as the CSC differentiation shifts from symmetric to asymmetric pattern, resistant cancer cells start accumulating in the tumor that makes it refractory to therapeutic interventions. Model analyses unveiled the presence of feedback loops that establish the dual role of M2 macrophages in regulating tumor proliferation. The study further revealed oscillations in the tumor sub-populations in the presence of TH1 derived IFN-\u03b3 that eliminates CSC; and the role of IL10 feedback in the regulation of TH1/TH2 ratio. These analyses expose important observations that are indicative of Cancer prognosis. Further, the model has been used for testing known treatment protocols to explore the reasons of failure of conventional treatment strategies and propose an improvised protocol that shows promising results in suppressing the proliferation of all the cellular sub-populations of the tumor and restoring a healthy TH1/TH2 ratio that assures better Cancer remission.",

The model consists of tumor-immune interaction and immune suppression from Tregs. In the absence of treatments, we first characterize the system dynamics by locating equilibrium points and determining stability properties. Next, cytokine induced killer (CIK) immunotherapy is incorporated. Numerical simulations of prognostic results illustrate that the median overall survival associated with treatment can be prolonged approximately from 7 to 13 months, which is consistent with the clinical data. Furthermore, we consider cyclophosphamide (CTX) therapy as well as the combined therapy with CIK and CTX. Intensive simulation results suggest that both CTX therapy and the combined CIK/CTX therapy can reduce the number of Tregs and increase the overall survival (OS), but Tregs and tumor cells will gradually rise to equilibrium state as long as therapies are ceased.",

Treatments of either CD4+ or cytokine are applied to study their effectiveness. It is found that doses of treatments are critical in determining the fate of the tumor, and tumor cells can be eliminated completely if doses of cytokine are large. Bistability is observed in models with either of the treatment strategies, which signifies that a careful planning of the treatment strategy is necessary for achieving a satisfactory outcome.",

The model describes the longitudinal volumetric dynamics of tumor response to TMZ of a cohort of 11 LGO patients treated with TMZ. After finding patient-specific parameters, different therapeutic strategies were tried computationally on the 'in-silico twins' of those patients. Chemotherapy schedules with larger-than-standard rest periods between consecutive cycles had either the same or better long-term efficacy than the standard 28-day cycles. The results were confirmed in a large trial of 2000 virtual patients. These long-cycle schemes would also have reduced toxicity and defer the appearance of resistances. On the basis of those results, a combination scheme consisting of five induction TMZ cycles given monthly plus 12 maintenance cycles given every three months was found to provide substantial survival benefits for the in-silico twins of the 11 LGO patients (median 5.69 years, range: 0.67 to 68.45 years) and in a large virtual trial including 2000 patients. We used 220 sets of experiments in-silico to show that a clinical trial incorporating 100 patients per arm (standard intensive treatment versus 5 + 12 scheme) could demonstrate the superiority of the novel scheme after a follow-up period of 10 years. Thus, the proposed treatment plan could be the basis for a standardized TMZ treatment for LGO patients with survival benefits.",

The aim of this work is to reproduce experimental results which find two possible outcomes depending on the initial quantities of the tumor and the adaptive immune cells. The ODE system is positively invariant and its solutions are bounded. The linear stability analysis of the fixed points of the model yields two groups of solutions depending on the initial conditions. In the first one, the immune system wins against the tumor cells, so the cancer disappears (elimination). In the second one, the cancer keeps on growing (escape). These results are coherent with experimental results which show these two possibilities, so the model reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the experiments. From the model some conclusions on the underlying competitive behavior can be derived.",

    "synopsis": "The transcription factor Myc plays a central role in regulating cell-fate decisions, including proliferation, growth, and apoptosis. To maintain a normal cell physiology, it is critical that the control of Myc dynamics is precisely orchestrated. Recent studies suggest that such control of Myc can be achieved at the post-translational level via protein stability modulation. Myc is regulated by two Ras effector pathways: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. To gain quantitative insight into Myc dynamics, we have developed a mathematical model to analyze post-translational regulation of Myc via sequential phosphorylation by Erk and PI3K. Our results suggest that Myc integrates Erk and PI3K signals to result in various cellular responses by differential stability control of Myc protein isoforms. Such signal integration confers a flexible dynamic range for the system output, governed by stability change. In addition, signal integration may require saturation of the input signals, leading to sensitive signal integration to the temporal features of the input signals, insensitive response to their amplitudes, and resistance to input fluctuations. We further propose that these characteristics of the protein stability control module in Myc may be commonly utilized in various cell types and classes of proteins.",

Our immediate goal is to quantify the influence of IL-6 on cancer stem cell self-renewal and survival, and to characterize the subsequent impact on tumor growth dynamics. By including the molecular details of IL-6 binding, we are able to quantify the temporal changes in fractional occupancies of bound receptors and their influence on tumor volume. There is a strong correlation between the model output and experimental data for primary tumor xenografts. We also used the model to predict tumor response to administration of the humanized IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), and we found that as little as 1mg/kg of TCZ administered weekly for 7 weeks is sufficient to result in tumor reduction and a sustained deceleration of tumor growth.",

    "synopsis": "A tumor is made up of a heterogeneous collection of cell types, all competing on a fitness landscape mediated by microenvironmental conditions that dictate their interactions. Despite the fact that much is known about cell signaling, cellular cooperation, and the functional constraints that affect cellular behavior, the specifics of how these constraints (and the range over which they act) affect the macroscopic tumor growth laws that govern total volume, mass, and carrying capacity remain poorly understood. We develop a statistical mechanics approach that focuses on the total number of possible states each cell can occupy and show how different assumptions on correlations of these states give rise to the many different macroscopic tumor growth laws used in the literature. Although it is widely understood that molecular and cellular heterogeneity within a tumor is a driver of growth, here we emphasize that focusing on the functional coupling of states at the cellular level is what determines macroscopic growth characteristics.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:In recent decades, cancer has become one of the most fatal and destructive diseases which is threatening humans life. Accordingly, different types of cancer treatment are studied with the main aim to have the best treatment with minimum side effects. Anti-angiogenic is a molecular targeted therapy which can be coupled with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although this method does not eliminate the whole tumor, but it can keep the tumor size in a given state by preventing the formation of new blood vessels. In this paper, a novel model-free method based on reinforcement learning (RL) framework is used to design a closed-loop control of anti-angiogenic drug dosing administration. METHODS:A Q-learning algorithm is developed for the drug dosing closed-loop control. This controller is designed using two different values of the maximum drug dosage to reduce the tumor volume up to a desired value. The mathematical model of tumor growth under anti-angiogenic inhibitor is used to simulate a real patient. RESULTS:The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through in silico simulation and its robustness to patient parameters variation is demonstrated. It is demonstrated that the tumor reaches its minimal volume in 84 days with maximum drug inlet of 30 mg/kg/day. Also, it is shown that the designed controller is robust with respect to \u202f\u00b1\u202f20% of tumor growth parameters changes. CONCLUSION:The proposed closed-loop reinforcement learning-based controller for cancer treatment using anti-angiogenic inhibitor provides an effective and novel result such that with a clinically valid and safe dosage of drug, the volume reduces up to 1mm3 in a reasonable short period compared to the literature.",

    "synopsis": "Signal integration has a crucial role in the cell fate decision and dysregulation of the cellular signaling pathways is a primary characteristic of cancer. As a signal integrator, mTOR shows a complex dynamical behavior which determines the cell fate at different cellular processes levels, including cell cycle progression, cell survival, cell death, metabolic reprogramming, and aging. The dynamics of the complex responses to rapamycin in cancer cells have been attributed to its differential time-dependent inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2, the two main complexes of mTOR. Two explanations were previously provided for this phenomenon: 1-Rapamycin does not inhibit mTORC2 directly, whereas it prevents mTORC2 formation by sequestering free mTOR protein (Le Chatelier's principle). 2-Components like Phosphatidic Acid (PA) further stabilize mTORC2 compared with mTORC1. To understand the mechanism by which rapamycin differentially inhibits the mTOR complexes in the cancer cells, we present a mathematical model of rapamycin mode of action based on the first explanation, i.e., Le Chatelier's principle. Translating the interactions among components of mTORC1 and mTORC2 into a mathematical model revealed the dynamics of rapamycin action in different doses and time-intervals of rapamycin treatment. This model shows that rapamycin has stronger effects on mTORC1 compared with mTORC2, simply due to its direct interaction with free mTOR and mTORC1, but not mTORC2, without the need to consider other components that might further stabilize mTORC2. Based on our results, even when mTORC2 is less stable compared with mTORC1, it can be less inhibited by rapamycin.",

    "synopsis": "The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling network is an evolutionarily conserved network that controls key cellular processes, including cell growth and metabolism. Consisting of the major kinase complexes mTOR Complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2), the mTOR network harbours complex interactions and feedback loops. The DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) was recently identified as an endogenous inhibitor of both mTORC1 and 2 through direct interactions, and is in turn degraded by mTORC1/2, adding an extra layer of complexity to the mTOR network. Yet, the dynamic properties of the DEPTOR-mTOR network and the roles of DEPTOR in coordinating mTORC1/2 activation dynamics have not been characterised. Using computational modelling, systems analysis and dynamic simulations we show that DEPTOR confers remarkably rich and complex dynamic behaviours to mTOR signalling, including abrupt, bistable switches, oscillations and co-existing bistable/oscillatory responses. Transitions between these distinct modes of behaviour are enabled by modulating DEPTOR expression alone. We characterise the governing conditions for the observed dynamics by elucidating the network in its vast multi-dimensional parameter space, and develop strategies to identify core network design motifs underlying these dynamics. Our findings provide new systems-level insights into the complexity of mTOR signalling contributed by DEPTOR.",

Age-related erosion of the T cell compartment has been implicated as a likely cause, but the underlying mechanisms driving this immunosenescence have not been quantitatively modeled and systematically analyzed. T cell receptor diversity, or the extent of pathogen-derived antigen responsiveness of the T cell pool, is known to diminish with age, but inherent experimental difficulties preclude accurate analysis on the full organismal level. In this paper, we formulate a mechanistic mathematical model of T cell population dynamics on the immunoclonal subpopulation level, which provides quantitative estimates of diversity. We define different estimates for diversity that depend on the individual number of cells in a specific immunoclone. We show that diversity decreases with age primarily due to diminished thymic output of new T cells and the resulting overall loss of small immunoclones.",

Resistance is typically thought to arise from random genetic mutations, after which mutated cells expand via Darwinian selection. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that progression to drug resistance need not occur randomly, but instead may be induced by the treatment itself via either genetic changes or epigenetic alterations. This relatively novel notion of resistance complicates the already challenging task of designing effective treatment protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS:To better understand resistance, we have developed a mathematical modeling framework that incorporates both spontaneous and drug-induced resistance. RESULTS:Our model demonstrates that the ability of a drug to induce resistance can result in qualitatively different responses to the same drug dose and delivery schedule. We have also proven that the induction parameter in our model is theoretically identifiable and propose an in vitro protocol that could be used to determine a treatment's propensity to induce resistance.",

    "synopsis": "Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.",

    "synopsis": "Gefitinib, one of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is effective for treating lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation; but later, most cases acquire a resistance to gefitinib. One of the mechanisms conferring gefitinib resistance to lung adenocarcinoma is the amplification of the MET gene, which is observed in 5-22% of gefitinib-resistant tumors. A previous study suggested that MET amplification could cause gefitinib resistance by driving ErbB3-dependent activation of the PI3K pathway. In this study, we built a mathematical model of gefitinib resistance caused by MET amplification using lung adenocarcinoma HCC827-GR (gefitinib resistant) cells. The molecular reactions involved in gefitinib resistance consisted of dimerization and phosphorylation of three molecules, EGFR, ErbB3, and MET were described by a series of ordinary differential equations. To perform a computer simulation, we quantified each molecule on the cell surface using flow cytometry and estimated unknown parameters by dimensional analysis. Our simulation showed that the number of active ErbB3 molecules is around a hundred-fold smaller than that of active MET molecules. Limited contribution of ErbB3 in gefitinib resistance by MET amplification is also demonstrated using HCC827-GR cells in culture experiments. Our mathematical model provides a quantitative understanding of the molecular reactions underlying drug resistance.",

    "synopsis": "The local hemodynamic shear stress waveforms present in an artery dictate the endothelial cell phenotype. The observed decrease of the apical glycocalyx layer on the endothelium in atheroprone regions of the circulation suggests that the glycocalyx may have a central role in determining atherosclerotic plaque formation. However, the kinetics for the cells' ability to adapt its glycocalyx to the environment have not been quantitatively resolved. Here we report that the heparan sulfate component of the glycocalyx of HUVECs increases by 1.4-fold following the onset of high shear stress, compared to static cultured cells, with a time constant of 19\u00a0h. Cell morphology experiments show that 12\u00a0h are required for the cells to elongate, but only after 36\u00a0h have the cells reached maximal alignment to the flow vector. Our findings demonstrate that following enzymatic degradation, heparan sulfate is restored to the cell surface within 12\u00a0h under flow whereas the time required is 20\u00a0h under static conditions. We also propose a model describing the contribution of endocytosis and exocytosis to apical heparan sulfate expression. The change in HS regrowth kinetics from static to high-shear EC phenotype implies a differential in the rate of endocytic and exocytic membrane turnover.",

    "synopsis": "The Hippo signalling pathway has recently emerged as an important regulator of cell apoptosis and proliferation with significant implications in human diseases. In mammals, the pathway contains the core kinases MST1/2, which phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2 kinases. The pro-apoptotic function of the MST/LATS signalling axis was previously linked to the Akt and ERK MAPK pathways, demonstrating that the Hippo pathway does not act alone but crosstalks with other signalling pathways to coordinate network dynamics and cellular outcomes. These crosstalks were characterised by a multitude of complex regulatory mechanisms involving competitive protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation mediated feedback loops. However, how these different mechanisms interplay in different cellular contexts to drive the context-specific network dynamics of Hippo-ERK signalling remains elusive. Using mathematical modelling and computational analysis, we uncovered that the Hippo-ERK network can generate highly diverse dynamical profiles that can be clustered into distinct dose-response patterns. For each pattern, we offered mechanistic explanation that defines when and how the observed phenomenon can arise. We demonstrated that Akt displays opposing, dose-dependent functions towards ERK, which are mediated by the balance between the Raf-1/MST2 protein interaction module and the LATS1 mediated feedback regulation. Moreover, Ras displays a multi-functional role and drives biphasic responses of both MST2 and ERK activities; which are critically governed by the competitive protein interaction between MST2 and Raf-1. Our study represents the first in-depth and systematic analysis of the Hippo-ERK network dynamics and provides a concrete foundation for future studies.",

    "synopsis": "The insulin signalling pathway (ISP) is an important biochemical pathway, which regulates some fundamental biological functions such as glucose and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. In the last years, different mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations have been proposed in the literature to describe specific features of the ISP, thus providing a description of the behaviour of the system and its emerging properties. However, protein-protein interactions potentially generate a multiplicity of distinct chemical species, an issue referred to as \"combinatorial complexity\", which results in defining a high number of state variables equal to the number of possible protein modifications. This often leads to complex, error prone and difficult to handle model definitions.In this work, we present a comprehensive model of the ISP, which integrates three models previously available in the literature by using the rule-based modelling (RBM) approach. RBM allows for a simple description of a number of signalling pathway characteristics, such as the phosphorylation of signalling proteins at multiple sites with different effects, the simultaneous interaction of many molecules of the signalling pathways with several binding partners, and the information about subcellular localization where reactions take place. Thanks to its modularity, it also allows an easy integration of different pathways. After RBM specification, we simulated the dynamic behaviour of the ISP model and validated it using experimental data. We the examined the predicted profiles of all the active species and clustered them in four clusters according to their dynamic behaviour. Finally, we used parametric sensitivity analysis to show the role of negative feedback loops in controlling the robustness of the system.The presented ISP model is a powerful tool for data simulation and can be used in combination with experimental approaches to guide the experimental design.

We simulated specific cases corresponding to localized disruptions in the graded pattern of these parameters along a hepatic sinusoid. Simulations incorporating locally altered parameters exhibited Ca(2+) waves that do not propagate throughout the hepatic plate. Increased gap junction coupling restored normal Ca(2+) wave propagation when hepatocytes with low Ca(2+) signaling ability were localized in the midlobular or the pericentral region.Multiple spatial patterns in intracellular signaling parameters can lead to Ca(2+) wave propagation that is consistent with the experimentally observed spatial patterns of Ca(2+) dynamics. Based on simulations and analysis, we predict that increased gap junction-mediated intercellular coupling can induce robust Ca(2+) signals in otherwise poorly responsive hepatocytes, at least partly restoring the sinusoidally oriented Ca (2+) waves.Our bottom-up model of agonist-evoked spatial Ca(2+) patterns can be integrated with detailed descriptions of liver histology to study Ca(2+) regulation at the tissue level.",

    "title": "A model reduction method for biochemical reaction networks.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: In this paper we propose a model reduction method for biochemical reaction networks governed by a variety of reversible and irreversible enzyme kinetic rate laws, including reversible Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics. The method proceeds by a stepwise reduction in the number of complexes, defined as the left and right-hand sides of the reactions in the network. It is based on the Kron reduction of the weighted Laplacian matrix, which describes the graph structure of the complexes and reactions in the network. It does not rely on prior knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of the network and hence can be automated, as we demonstrate. The reduced network has fewer complexes, reactions, variables and parameters as compared to the original network, and yet the behaviour of a preselected set of significant metabolites in the reduced network resembles that of the original network. Moreover the reduced network largely retains the structure and kinetics of the original model. RESULTS: We apply our method to a yeast glycolysis model and a rat liver fatty acid beta-oxidation model. When the number of state variables in the yeast model is reduced from 12 to 7, the difference between metabolite concentrations in the reduced and the full model, averaged over time and species, is only 8%. Likewise, when the number of state variables in the rat-liver beta-oxidation model is reduced from 42 to 29, the difference between the reduced model and the full model is 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The method has improved our understanding of the dynamics of the two networks. We found that, contrary to the general disposition, the first few metabolites which were deleted from the network during our stepwise reduction approach, are not those with the shortest convergence times. It shows that our reduction approach performs differently from other approaches that are based on time-scale separation. The method can be used to facilitate fitting of the parameters or to embed a detailed model of interest in a more coarse-grained yet realistic environment.",

    "synopsis": "Advances in genetic engineering have made it possible to reprogram individual immune cells to express receptors that recognise markers on tumour cell surfaces. The process of re-engineering T cell lymphocytes to express Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs), and then re-infusing the CAR-modified T cells into patients to treat various cancers is referred to as CAR T cell therapy. This therapy is being explored in clinical trials - most prominently for B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL), a common B cell malignancy, for which CAR T cell therapy has led to remission in up to 90% of patients. Despite this extraordinary response rate, however, potentially fatal inflammatory side effects occur in up to 10% of patients who have positive responses. Further, approximately 50% of patients who initially respond to the therapy relapse. Significant improvement is thus necessary before the therapy can be made widely available for use in the clinic.\r\n\r\nTo inform future development, we develop a mathematical model to explore interactions between CAR T cells, inflammatory toxicity, and individual patients\u2019 tumour burdens in silico. This paper outlines the underlying system of coupled ordinary differential equations designed based on well-known immunological principles and widely accepted views on the mechanism of toxicity development in CAR T cell therapy for B-ALL - and reports in silico outcomes in relationship to standard and recently conjectured predictors of toxicity in a heterogeneous, randomly generated patient population. Our initial results and analyses are consistent with and connect immunological mechanisms to the clinically observed, counterintuitive hypothesis that initial tumour burden is a stronger predictor of toxicity than is the dose of CAR T cells administered to patients.\r\n\r\nWe outline how the mechanism of action in CAR T cell therapy can give rise to such non-standard trends in toxicity development, and demonstrate the utility of mathematical modelling in understanding the relationship between predictors of toxicity, mechanism of action, and patient outcomes.",

    "synopsis": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are becoming widely used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, the ability to predict the patient's benefit from these therapeutics remains an unmet clinical need. Mathematical models that predict melanoma patients' response to ICI can contribute to better informed clinical decisions. Here, we developed a simple mathematical population model for pembrolizumab-treated advanced melanoma patients, and analyzed the local and global dynamics of the system. Our results show that zero, one, or two steady states of the mathematical system exist in the phase plane, depending on the parameter values of individual patients. Without treatment, the simulated tumors grew uncontrollably. At increased efficacy of the immune system, e.g., due to immunotherapy, two steady states were found, one leading to uncontrollable tumor growth, and the other resulting in tumor size stabilization. Model analysis indicates that a sufficient increase in the activation of CD8+ T cells results in stable disease, whereas a significant reduction in T-cell exhaustion, another process contributing CD8+ T cell activity, temporarily reduces the tumor mass, but fails to control disease progression in the long run. Importantly, the initial tumor burden influences the response to treatment: small tumors respond better to treatment than larger tumors. In conclusion, our model suggests that disease progression and response to ICI depend on the ratio between activation and exhaustion rates of CD8+ T cells. The analysis of the model provides a foundation for the use of computational methods to personalize immunotherapy.",

    "synopsis": "The molecular oscillator of the mammalian circadian clock consists in a dynamical network of genes and proteins whose main regulatory mechanisms occur at the transcriptional level. From a dynamical point of view, the mechanisms leading to an oscillatory solution with an orderly protein peak expression and a clear day/night phase distinction remain unclear. Our goal is to identify the essential interactions needed to generate phase opposition between the activating CLOCK:BMAL1 and the repressing PER:CRY complexes and to better distinguish these two main clock molecular phases relating to rest/activity and fast/feeding cycles. To do this, we develop a transcription-based mathematical model centered on linear combinations of the clock controlled elements (CCEs): E-box, R-box and D-box. Each CCE is responsive to activators and repressors. After model calibration with single-cell data, we explore entrainment and period tuning via interplay with metabolism. Variation of the PER degradation rate \u03b3p, relating to the tau mutation, results in asymmetric changes in the duration of the different clock molecular phases. Time spent at the state of high PER/PER:CRY decreases with \u03b3p, while time spent at the state of high BMAL1 and CRY1, both proteins with activity in promoting insulin sensitivity, remains constant. This result suggests a possible mechanism behind the altered metabolism of tau mutation animals. Furthermore, we expose the clock system to two regulatory inputs, one relating to the fast/feeding cycle and the other to the light-dependent synchronization signaling. We observe the phase difference between these signals to also affect the relative duration of molecular clock states. Simulated circadian misalignment, known to correlate with insulin resistance, leads to decreased duration of BMAL1 expression. Our results reveal a possible mechanism for clock-controlled metabolic homeostasis, whereby the circadian clock controls the relative duration of different molecular (and metabolic) states in response to signaling inputs.",

    "synopsis": "The prescription drug epidemic in the United States has gained attention in recent years. Vicodin, along with its generic version, is the country's mostly widely prescribed pain reliever, and it contains a narcotic component that can lead to physical and chemical dependency. The majority of Vicodin abusers were first introduced via prescription, unlike other drugs which are often experienced for the first time due to experimentation. Most abusers report obtaining their supply from a prescription, either their own or someone else's. Although the problem with prescription drug abuse is well known, there is no standard method of addressing the problem. To better understand how to do this, we develop and analyze a mathematical model of Vicodin use and abuse, considering only those patients who were initially prescribed the drug. Through global sensitivity analysis, we show that focusing efforts on abuse prevention rather than treatment has greater success at reducing the population of Vicodin abusers. Our results demonstrate that relying solely on rehabilitation and other treatment programs is not enough to combat the prescription drug problem in the United States. We anticipate that implementing preventative measures in both prescribers and patients will reduce the number of Vicodin abusers.",

    "synopsis": "Oscillations are crucial to the normal function of living organisms, across a wide variety of biological processes. In eukaryotes, oscillatory dynamics are thought to arise from interactions at the protein and RNA levels; however, the role of non-coding RNA in regulating these dynamics remains understudied. In this work, we show how non-coding RNA acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges in a conserved miRNA - transcription factor feedback motif, can give rise to oscillatory behaviour, and how to test for this experimentally. Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit. These results, supported by emerging evidence for the role of miRNA sponges in development, point towards key roles of different species of miRNA sponges, such as circular RNA, potentially in the maintenance of yet unexplained oscillatory behaviour. These results help to provide a paradigm for understanding functional differences between the many redundant, but distinct RNA species thought to act as miRNA sponges in nature, such as long non-coding RNA, pseudogenes, competing mRNA, circular RNA, and3' UTRs.",

In this paper, we combined experimental approaches with computational modeling to decipher the molecular mechanisms as well as the hidden dynamics governing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT(1A)R) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells. We built an abstracted ordinary differential equations (ODE)-based model that captured the available knowledge and experimental data. We inferred the unknown parameters by simultaneously fitting experimental data generated in both control and perturbed conditions. We demonstrate that, in addition to its well-established function in the desensitization of G-protein activation, GRK2 exerts a strong negative effect on \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling through its competition with GRK5 and 6 for receptor phosphorylation. Importantly, we experimentally confirmed the validity of this novel GRK2-dependent mechanism in both primary vascular smooth muscle cells naturally expressing the AT(1A)R, and HEK293 cells expressing other 7TMRs.",

In this respect, a prominent example is Hsp70, a chaperone protein whose synthesis is dynamically regulated in stress conditions. In this paper, we expand a formal model of Hsp70 heat induction originally proposed in previous articles. To accurately capture various modes of heat shock effects, we not only introduce temperature dependencies in transcription to Hsp70\u00a0mRNA and in dissociation of transcriptional complexes, but we also derive a new formal expression for the temperature dependence in protein denaturation. We calibrate our model using comprehensive sets of both previously published experimental data and also biologically justified constraints. Interestingly, we obtain a biologically plausible temperature dependence of the transcriptional complex dissociation, despite the lack of biological constraints imposed in the calibration process. Finally, based on a sensitivity analysis of the model carried out in both deterministic and stochastic settings, we suggest that the regulation of the binding of transcriptional complexes plays a key role in Hsp70 induction upon heat shock. In conclusion, we provide a model that is able to capture the essential dynamics of the Hsp70 heat induction whilst being biologically sound in terms of temperature dependencies, description of protein denaturation and imposed calibration constraints.",

We investigate the mechanisms underlying their bursting, and make experimentally-testable predictions. The ionic currents included in the model are specific to ET cells, and their kinetic and other parameters are based on experimental recordings. We validate the model by showing that its bursting characteristics under various conditions (e.g. blocking various currents) are consistent with experimental observations. Further, we identify the bifurcation structure and dynamics that explain bursting behavior. This analysis allows us to make predictions of the response of the cell to current pulses at different burst phases. We find that depolarizing (but not hyperpolarizing) inputs received during the interburst interval can advance burst timing, creating the substrate for synchronization by excitatory connections. It has been hypothesized that such synchronization among the ET cells within one glomerulus might help coordinate the glomerular output. Next we investigate model parameter sensitivity and identify parameters that play the most prominent role in controlling each burst characteristic, such as the burst frequency and duration. Finally, the response of the cell to periodic inputs is examined, reflecting the sniffing-modulated input that these cell receive in vivo. We find that individual cells can be better entrained by inputs with higher, rather than lower, frequencies than the intrinsic bursting frequency of the cell. Nevertheless, a heterogeneous population of ET cells (as may be found in a glomerulus) is able to produce reliable periodic population responses even at lower input frequencies.",

    "synopsis": "In higher plants, the amino acid phenylalanine is a substrate of both primary and secondary metabolic pathways. The primary pathway that consumes phenylalanine, protein biosynthesis, is essential for the viability of all cells. Meanwhile, the secondary pathways are not necessary for the survival of individual cells, but benefit of the plant as a whole. Here we focus on the monolignol pathway, a secondary metabolic pathway in the cytosol that rapidly consumes phenylalanine to produce the precursors of lignin during wood formation. In planta\u00a0monolignol biosynthesis involves a series of seemingly redundant steps wherein shikimate, a precursor of phenylalanine synthesized in the plastid, is transiently ligated to the main substrate of the pathway. However, shikimate is not catalytically involved in the reactions of the monolignol pathway, and is only needed for pathway enzymes to recognize their main substrates. After some steps the shikimate moiety is removed unaltered, and the main substrate continues along the pathway. It has been suggested that this portion of the monolignol pathway fulfills a regulatory role in the following way. Low phenylalanine concentrations (viz. availability) correlate with low shikimate concentrations. When shikimate concentratios are low, flux into the monolignol pathway will be limited by means of the steps requiring shikimate. Thus, when the concentration of phenylalanine is low it will be reserved for protein biosynthesis. Here we employ a theoretical approach to test this hypothesis. Simplified versions of plant phenylalanine metabolism are modelled as systems of ordinary differential equations. Our analysis shows that the seemingly redundant steps can be sufficient for the prioritization of protein biosynthesis over the monolignol pathway when the availability of phenylalanine is low, depending on system parameters. Thus, the phenylalanine precursor shikimate may signal low phenylalanine availability to secondary pathways. Because our models have been abstracted from plant phenylalanine metabolism, this mechanism of metabolic signalling, which we call the Precursor Shutoff Valve (PSV), may also be present in other biochemical networks comprised of two pathways that share a common substrate.",

The optimal dimensioning of minerals in the diet, one being potassium, is indispensable for the prevention of imbalances. Potassium balance in cows is the result of potassium intake, distribution in the organism, and excretion, and it is closely related to glucose and electrolyte metabolism. In this paper, we present a dynamical model for potassium balance in lactating and nonlactating dairy cows based on ordinary differential equations. Parameter values were obtained from clinical trial data and from the literature. To verify the consistency of the model, we present simulation outcomes for 3 different scenarios: potassium balance in (1) nonlactating cows with varying feed intake, (2) nonlactating cows with varying potassium fraction in the diet, and (3) lactating cows with varying milk production levels. The results give insights into the short- and long-term potassium metabolism, providing an important step toward the understanding of the potassium network, the design of prophylactic feed additives, and possible treatment strategies.",

    "synopsis": "Oncolytic viruses are genetically engineered to treat growing tumours and represent a very promising therapeutic strategy. Using a Gompertz growth law, we discuss a model that captures the in vivo dynamics of a cancer under treatment with an oncolytic virus. With the aid of local stability analysis and bifurcation plots, the typical interactions between virus and tumour are investigated. The system shows a singular equilibrium and a number of nonlinear behaviours that have interesting biological consequences, such as long-period oscillations and bistable states where two different outcomes can occur depending on the initial conditions. Complete tumour eradication appears to be possible only for parameter combinations where viral characteristics match well with the tumour growth rate. Interestingly, the model shows that therapies with a high initial injection or involving a highly effective virus do not universally result in successful strategies for eradication. Further, the use of additional, \"boosting\" injection schedules does not always lead to complete eradication. Our framework, instead, suggests that low viral loads can be in some cases more effective than high loads, and that a less resilient virus can help avoid high amplitude oscillations between tumours and virus. Finally, the model points to a number of interesting findings regarding the role of oscillations and bistable states between a tumour and an oncolytic virus. Strategies for the elimination of such fluctuations depend strongly on the initial viral load and the combination of parameters describing the features of the tumour and virus.",

Weekly data from December 2017 to May 2018 are obtained from the data base of the Centre of Health Protection in Hong Kong, and used to parametrise the models. With the help of these models, we investigate the impact of different vaccination strategies and determine the corresponding critical vaccination coverage for different vaccine efficacies. The results suggest that at least 72% of Hong Kong population should have been vaccinated during 2017-2018 winter to prevent the seasonal epidemic by herd immunity (while data showed that only a maximum of 11.6% of the population were vaccinated). Our results also show that the critical vaccination coverage decreases with increasing vaccine efficacy, and the increase in one influenza subtype vaccine efficacy may lead to an increase in infections caused by a different subtype.",

    "synopsis": "The chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are acquired stem cell neoplasms which ultimately may transform to acute myelogenous leukemia. Most recently, chronic inflammation has been described as an important factor for the development and progression of MPNs in the biological continuum from early cancer stage to the advanced myelofibrosis stage, the MPNs being described as \"A Human Inflammation Model for Cancer Development\". This novel concept has been built upon clinical, experimental, genomic, immunological and not least epidemiological studies. Only a few studies have described the development of MPNs by mathematical models, and none have addressed the role of inflammation for clonal evolution and disease progression. Herein, we aim at using mathematical modelling to substantiate the concept of chronic inflammation as an important trigger and driver of MPNs.The basics of the model describe the proliferation from stem cells to mature cells including mutations of healthy stem cells to become malignant stem cells. We include a simple inflammatory coupling coping with cell death and affecting the basic model beneath. First, we describe the system without feedbacks or regulatory interactions. Next, we introduce inflammatory feedback into the system. Finally, we include other feedbacks and regulatory interactions forming the inflammatory-MPN model. Using mathematical modeling, we add further proof to the concept that chronic inflammation may be both a trigger of clonal evolution and an important driving force for MPN disease progression. Our findings support intervention at the earliest stage of cancer development to target the malignant clone and dampen concomitant inflammation.",

    "synopsis": "The transition from early long-term potentiation (E-LTP) to late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is a multistep process that involves both protein synthesis and degradation. The ways in which these two opposing processes interact to establish L-LTP are not well understood, however. For example, L-LTP is attenuated by inhibiting either protein synthesis or proteasome-dependent degradation prior to and during a tetanic stimulus (e.g., Huang et\u00a0al., 1996; Karpova et\u00a0al., 2006), but paradoxically, L-LTP is not attenuated when synthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously (Fonseca\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02006). These paradoxical results suggest that counter-acting 'positive' and 'negative' proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate the basis of this paradox, we developed a model of LTP at the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. The model consists of nine ordinary differential equations that describe the levels of both positive- and negative-regulator proteins (PP and NP, respectively) and the transitions among five discrete synaptic states, including a basal state (BAS), three states corresponding to E-LTP (EP1, EP2, and ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). An LTP-inducing stimulus: 1) initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2; 2) initiates the synthesis of PP and NP; and finally; 3) activates the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which in turn, mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation of NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by the PP-dependent transition from ED to LP, whereas NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. We found that the inclusion of the five discrete synaptic states was necessary to simulate key empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block of L-LTP by either proteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation of L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together. Although our model is abstract, elements of the model can be correlated with specific molecular processes. Moreover, the model correctly captures the dynamics of protein synthesis- and degradation-dependent phases of LTP, and it makes testable predictions, such as a unique synaptic state (ED) that precedes the transition from E-LTP to L-LTP, and a well-defined time window for the action of the UPS (i.e., during the transitions from EP1 and EP2 to ED). Tests of these predictions will provide new insights into the processes and dynamics of long-term synaptic plasticity.",

    "synopsis": "Akt/PKB is a biochemical regulator that functions as an important cross-talk node between several signalling pathways in the mammalian cell. In particular, Akt is a key mediator of glucose transport in response to insulin. The phosphorylation (activation) of only a small percentage of the Akt pool of insulin-sensitive cells results in maximal translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (PM). This enables the diffusion of glucose into the cell. The dysregulation of Akt signalling is associated with the development of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Akt is synthesised in the cytoplasm in the inactive state. Under the influence of insulin, it moves to the PM, where it is phosphorylated to form pAkt. Although phosphorylation occurs only at the PM, pAkt is found in many cellular locations, including the PM, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus. Indeed, the spatial distribution of pAkt within the cell appears to be an important determinant of downstream regulation. Here we present a simple, linear, four-compartment ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of Akt activation that tracks both the biochemical state and the physical location of Akt. This model embodies the main features of the activation of this important cross-talk node and is consistent with the experimental data. In particular, it allows different downstream signalling motifs without invoking separate feedback pathways. Moreover, the model is computationally tractable, readily analysed, and elucidates some of the apparent anomalies in insulin signalling via Akt.",

    "synopsis": "The normal wound healing response is characterized by a progression from clot formation, to an inflammatory phase, to a repair phase, and finally, to remodeling. In many chronic wounds there is an extended inflammatory phase that stops this progression. In order to understand the inflammatory phase in more detail, we developed an ordinary differential equation model that accounts for two systemic mediators that are known to modulate this phase, estrogen (a protective hormone during wound healing) and cortisol (a hormone elevated after trauma that slows healing). This model describes the interactions in the wound between wound debris, pathogens, neutrophils and macrophages and the modulation of these interactions by estrogen and cortisol. A collection of parameter sets, which qualitatively match published data on the dynamics of wound healing, was chosen using Latin Hypercube Sampling. This collection of parameter sets represents normal healing in the population as a whole better than one single parameter set. Including the effects of estrogen and cortisol is a necessary step to creating a patient specific model that accounts for gender and trauma. Utilization of math modeling techniques to better understand the wound healing inflammatory phase could lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic wounds. This inflammatory phase model will later become the inflammatory subsystem of our full wound healing model, which includes fibroblast activity, collagen accumulation and remodeling.",

    "synopsis": "The size of a cell sets the scale for all biochemical processes within it, thereby affecting cellular fitness and survival. Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the START transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cell\u2019s overall ploidy and WHI5 gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect \u2018sizer\u2019 behaviour in G1 and a \u2018timer\u2019 in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an \u2018adder\u2019 over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.",

The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold in vivo. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.",

METHODS:A quantitative systems pharmacology model, which includes key elements of the cancer immunity cycle and the tumor microenvironment, tumor growth, as well as dose-exposure-target modulation features, was developed to reproduce experimental data of CT26 tumor size dynamics upon administration of RT and/or a pharmacological IO treatment such as an anti-PD-L1 agent. Variability in individual tumor size dynamics was taken into account using a mixed-effects model at the level of tumor-infiltrating T cell influx. RESULTS:The model allowed for a detailed quantitative understanding of the synergistic kinetic effects underlying immune cell interactions as linked to tumor size modulation, under these treatments. The model showed that the ability of T cells to infiltrate tumor tissue is a primary determinant of variability in individual tumor size dynamics and tumor response. The model was further used as an in silico evaluation tool to quantitatively predict, prospectively, untested treatment combination schedules and sequences. We demonstrate that anti-PD-L1 administration prior to, or concurrently with RT reveal further synergistic effects, which, according to the model, may materialize due to more favorable dynamics between RT-induced immuno-modulation and reduced immuno-suppression of T cells through anti-PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS:This study provides quantitative mechanistic explanations of the links between RT and anti-tumor immune responses, and describes how optimized combinations and schedules of immunomodulation and radiation may tip the immune balance in favor of the host, sufficiently to lead to tumor shrinkage or rejection.",

    "synopsis": "The aim of this study was to show how computational models can be used to increase our understanding of the role of microRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA) using miR-140 as an example. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental results from the literature were used to create and calibrate models of gene regulatory networks in OA involving miR-140 along with key regulators such as NF-\u03baB, SMAD3, and RUNX2. The individual models were created with the modelling standard, Systems Biology Markup Language, and integrated to examine the overall effect of miR-140 on cartilage homeostasis. Down-regulation of miR-140 may have either detrimental or protective effects for cartilage, indicating that the role of miR-140 is complex. Studies of individual networks in isolation may therefore lead to different conclusions. This indicated the need to combine the five chosen individual networks involving miR-140 into an integrated model. This model suggests that the overall effect of miR-140 is to change the response to an IL-1 stimulus from a prolonged increase in matrix degrading enzymes to a pulse-like response so that cartilage degradation is temporary. Our current model can easily be modified and extended as more experimental data become available about the role of miR-140 in OA. In addition, networks of other microRNAs that are important in OA could be incorporated. A fully integrated model could not only aid our understanding of the mechanisms of microRNAs in ageing cartilage but could also provide a useful tool to investigate the effect of potential interventions to prevent cartilage loss.",

    "title": "Immunobiochemical Reconstruction of Influenza Lung Infection-Melanoma Skin Cancer Interactions.",
    "synopsis": "It was recently reported that acute influenza infection of the lung promoted distal melanoma growth in the dermis of mice. Melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells were shunted to the lung in the presence of the infection, where they expressed high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker PD-1, and became incapable of migrating back to the tumor site. At the same time, co-infection virus-specific CD8+ T cells remained functional while the infection was cleared. It was also unexpectedly found that PD-1 blockade immunotherapy reversed this effect. Here, we proceed to ground the experimental observations in a mechanistic immunobiochemical model that incorporates T cell pathways that control PD-1 expression. A core component of our model is a kinetic motif, which we call a PD-1 Double Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (DIFFL), and which reflects known interactions between IRF4, Blimp-1, and Bcl-6. The different activity levels of the PD-1 DIFFL components, as a function of the cognate antigen levels and the given inflammation context, manifest themselves in phenotypically distinct outcomes. Collectively, the model allowed us to put forward a few working hypotheses as follows: (i) the melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells re-circulating with the blood flow enter the lung where they express high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker PD-1 in the presence of infection; (ii) when PD-1 receptors interact with abundant PD-L1, constitutively expressed in the lung, T cells loose motility; (iii) at the same time, virus-specific cells adapt to strong stimulation by their cognate antigen by lowering the transiently-elevated expression of PD-1, remaining functional and mobile in the inflamed lung, while the infection is cleared. The role that T cell receptor (TCR) activation and feedback loops play in the underlying processes are also highlighted and discussed. We hope that the results reported in our study could potentially contribute to the advancement of immunological approaches to cancer treatment and, as well, to a better understanding of a broader complexity of fundamental interactions between pathogens and tumors.",

    "synopsis": "Natural killer (NK) cells belong to the first line of host defense against infection and cancer. Cytokines, including interleukin-15 (IL-15), critically regulate NK cell activity, resulting in recognition and direct killing of transformed and infected target cells. NK cells have to adapt and respond in inflamed and often hypoxic areas. Cellular stabilization and accumulation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a key mechanism of the cellular hypoxia response. At the same time, HIF-1\u03b1 plays a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity. While the HIF-1\u03b1 hydroxylation and degradation pathway has been recently described with the help of mathematical methods, less is known concerning the mechanistic mathematical description of processes regulating the levels of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein. In this work we combine mathematical modeling with experimental laboratory analysis and examine the dynamic relationship between HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA, HIF-1\u03b1 protein, and IL-15-mediated upstream signaling events in NK cells from human blood. We propose a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations with positive and negative feedback loops for describing the complex interplay of HIF-1\u03b1 regulators. The experimental design is optimized with the help of mathematical methods, and numerical optimization techniques yield reliable parameter estimates. The mathematical model allows for the investigation and prediction of HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization under different inflammatory conditions and provides a better understanding of mechanisms mediating cellular enrichment of HIF-1\u03b1. Thanks to the combination of in vitro experimental data and in silico predictions we identified the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as central regulators of HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation. We hypothesize that the regulatory pathway proposed here for NK cells can be extended to other types of immune cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the dynamic regulation of the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway in immune cells is of central importance to the immune cell function and could be a promising strategy in the design of treatments for human inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

To determine the role of HIV-associated immune suppression on HPV persistence and pathogenesis, and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the modulation of HPV infection and oral cancer by HIV, we developed a mathematical model of HIV/HPV co-infection. Our model captures known immunological and molecular features such as impaired HPV-specific effector T helper 1 (Th1) cell responses, and enhanced HPV infection due to HIV. We used the model to determine HPV prognosis in the presence of HIV infection, and identified conditions under which HIV infection alters HPV persistence in the oral mucosa system. The model predicts that conditions leading to HPV persistence during HIV/HPV co-infection are the permissive immune environment created by HIV and molecular interactions between the two viruses. The model also determines when HPV infection continues to persist in the short run in a co-infected patient undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, the model predicts that, under efficacious antiretroviral treatment, HPV infections will decrease in the long run due to the restoration of CD4+ T cell numbers and protective immune responses.",

    "synopsis": "IL-6 has been proposed to favor the development of Th2 responses and play an important role in the communication between cells of multicellular organisms. They are involved in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and act as key player during inflammation and immune response. Th2 cytokines play an immunoregulatory role in early infection. Literature says in mice infected with L. major, IL-6 may promote the development of both Th1 and Th2 responses. IL-4 is also considered to be the signature cytokine of Th-2 response. IL-10 was initially characterized as a Th2 cytokine but later on it was proved to be a pleiotropic cytokine, secreted from different cell types including the macrophages. A major challenge is to understand how these complex non-linear processes are connected and regulated. Systems biology approaches may be used to tackle this challenge in an iterative process of quantitative mathematical analysis. In this study, we created an in silico model of IL6 mediated macrophage activation which suffers from an excessive impact of the negative feedback loop involving SOCS3. The strategy adopted in this framework may help to reduce the complexity of the leishmanial IL6 model analysis and also laydown various physiological or pathological conditions of IL6 signaling in future.",

    "synopsis": "We examine a model for the interaction of HIV with CD4+ T cells that considers four populations: uninfected T cells, latently infected T cells, actively infected T cells, and free virus. Using this model we show that many of the puzzling quantitative features of HIV infection can be explained simply. We also consider effects of AZT on viral growth and T-cell population dynamics. The model exhibits two steady states, an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected state, in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if N, the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T cell, is less a critical value, Ncrit, then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative orthant, and this state is stable. For N > Ncrit, the uninfected state is unstable, and the endemically infected state can be either stable, or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is stable, it is characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment of this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T cells, during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows exponentially, and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation the model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in the model. The model predicts that different viral strains, characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T cells, can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate depletion at different rates. Two versions of the model are studied. In one the source of T cells from precursors is constant, whereas in the other the source of T cells decreases with viral load, mimicking the infection and killing of T-cell precursors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "synopsis": "Mathematical modeling combined with experimental measurements have yielded important insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis. For example, data from experiments in which HIV-infected patients are given potent antiretroviral drugs that perturb the infection process have been used to estimate kinetic parameters underlying HIV infection. Many of the models used to analyze data have assumed drug treatments to be completely efficacious and that upon infection a cell instantly begins producing virus. We consider a model that allows for less then perfect drug effects and which includes a delay in the initiation of virus production. We present detailed analysis of this delay differential equation model and compare the results to a model without delay. Our analysis shows that when drug efficacy is less than 100%, as may be the case in vivo, the predicted rate of decline in plasma virus concentration depends on three factors: the death rate of virus producing cells, the efficacy of therapy, and the length of the delay. Thus, previous estimates of infected cell loss rates can be improved upon by considering more realistic models of viral infection.",

    "synopsis": "CD4 T cells play a fundamental role in the adaptive immune response including the stimulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which infects and kills CD4 T cells causes progressive failure of the immune system. However, HIV particles are also reproduced by the infected CD4 T cells. Therefore, during HIV infection, infected and healthy CD4 T cells act in opposition to each other, reproducing virus particles and activating and stimulating cellular immune responses, respectively. In this investigation, we develop and analyze a simple system of four ordinary differential equations that accounts for these two opposing roles of CD4 T cells. The model illustrates the importance of the CTL immune response during the asymptomatic stage of HIV infection. In addition, the solution behavior exhibits the two stages of infection, asymptomatic and final AIDS stages. In the model, a weak immune response results in a short asymptomatic stage and faster development of AIDS, whereas a strong immune response illustrates the long asymptomatic stage. A model with a latent stage for infected CD4 T cells is also investigated and compared numerically with the original model. The model shows that strong stimulation of CTLs by CD4 T cells is necessary to prevent progression to the AIDS stage.",

    "synopsis": "Virotherapy is one of the most promising therapies in the treatment of tumors which may be further combined with chemotherapy to accelerate the healing rate. In this article, we propose a mathematical model for the treatment of tumors using oncolytic virus and chemotherapy. This model takes the form of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the interactions between uninfected tumor cells, infected tumor cells, an oncolytic virus, and chemotherapy. It is assumed that the rate of infection between uninfected tumor cells and infected tumor cells is in a saturated form. The saturation effect takes into account the fact that the number of contacts between them reaches the maximum value when the immune system works to stop the virus. The dynamical analysis, which includes the existence of equilibrium points, and its stability analysis is investigated. The analysis result shows that the system has three equilibrium points: tumor-free equilibrium point, virus-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. It is proven that these equilibrium points are conditionally stable. The numerical simulations show the successful combination of chemotherapy and virotherapy using an oncolytic virus in eliminating the tumor cells.",

Initially, a gastrointestinal absorption term for glucose is utilized to effect the glucose absorption by the intestine and the subsequent release of glucose into the bloodstream, taking place at a given initial rate and falling off exponentially with time. An analysis of the model is carried out by the singular perturbation technique in order to derive boundary conditions on the system parameters which identify, in particular, the existence of limit cycles in our model system consistent with the oscillatory patterns often observed in clinical data. We then utilize a sinusoidal term to incorporate the temporal absorption of glucose in order to study the responses in the patients under ambulatory-fed conditions. A numerical investigation is carried out in this case to construct a bifurcation diagram to identify the ranges of parametric values for which chaotic behavior can be expected, leading to interesting biological interpretations.",

    "synopsis": "Immunotherapy is currently regarded as the most promising treatment to fight against cancer. This is particularly true in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an indolent neoplastic disease of B-lymphocytes which eventually causes the immune system's failure. In this and other areas of cancer research, mathematical modeling is pointed out as a prominent tool to analyze theoretical and practical issues. Its lack in studies of chemoimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is what motivated us to come up with a simple ordinary differential equation model. It is based on ideas of de Pillis and Radunskaya and on standard pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics assumptions. In order to check the positivity of the state variables, we first establish an invariant region where these time-dependent variables remain positive. Afterwards, the action of the immune system, as well as the chemoimmunotherapeutic role in promoting cancer cure are investigated by means of numerical simulations and the classical linear stability analysis. The role of adoptive cellular immunotherapy is also addressed. Our overall conclusion is that chemoimmunotherapeutic protocols can be effective in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided that chemotherapy is not a limiting factor to the immunotherapy efficacy.",

This model consists of four populations - tumor cells, dendritic cells (as an innate immune system), cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells (as a specific immune system) - in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations. Some tumors present dendritic cell and such cells have a potential role in regulating the immune system. In this model, we assume that dendritic cells can activate cytotoxic T cells and, in turn, can clear out tumor cells. Furthermore, by adding controls as a treatment to the model, we minimize both the tumor cell population and the cost of treatment. We do this by applying the optimal control for this problem. First, Pontryagin's Principle is used to characterize the optimal control. Then, the optimal system is solved numerically using the Forward-Backward Runge- Kutta method. Finally, the effect of each treatment is investigated. The numerical results show that these controls are effective in reducing the number of tumor cells.",

    "synopsis": "Aggressive cancers develop immune suppression mechanisms, allowing them to evade specific immune responses. Patients with active melanoma are polarized towards a T helper (Th) 2-type immune phenotype, which subverts effective anticancer Th1-type cellular immunity. The pro-inammatory factor, interleukin (IL)-12, can potentially restore Th1 responses in such patients, but still shows limited clinical efficacy and substantial side effects. We developed a model for the Th1/Th2 imbalance in melanoma patients and its regulation via IL-12 treatment. The model focuses on the interactions between the two Th cell types as mediated by their respective key cytokines, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and IL-10. Theoretical and numerical analysis showed a landscape consisting of a single, globally attracting steady state, which is stable under large ranges of relevant parameter values. Our results suggest that in melanoma, the cellular arm of the immune system cannot reverse tumor immunotolerance naturally, and that immunotherapy may be the only way to overturn tumor dominance. We have shown that given a toxicity threshold for IFN\u03b3, the maximal allowable IL-12 concentration to yield a Th1-polarized state can be estimated. Moreover, our analysis pinpoints the IL-10 secretion rate as a significant factor inuencing the Th1:Th2 balance, suggesting its use as a personal immunomarker for prognosis.",

    "synopsis": "MOTIVATION: \r\nVal600Glu (V600E) mutation is the most common BRAF mutation detected in thyroid cancer. Hence, recent research efforts have been performed trying to explore several inhibitors of the V600E mutation-containing BRAF kinase as potential therapeutic options in thyroid cancer refractory to standard interventions. Among them, vemurafenib is a selective BRAF inhibitor approved by FDA for clinical practice. Unfortunately, vemurafenib often displays limited efficacy in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas probably because of intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms. In this view, cancer stem cells may represent a possible mechanism of resistance to vemurafenib, due to their self-renewal and chemo resistance properties.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\nWe present a computational framework to suggest new potential targets to overcome drug resistance. It has been validated with an in vitro model based upon a spheroid-forming method able to isolate thyroid cancer stem cells that may mimic resistance to vemurafenib. Indeed, vemurafenib did not inhibit cell proliferation of BRAF V600E thyroid cancer stem cells, but rather stimulated cell proliferation along with a paradoxical overactivation of ERK and AKT pathways. The computational model identified a fundamental role of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAP3K8), a serine/threonine kinase expressed in thyroid cancer stem cells, in mediating this drug resistance. To confirm model prediction, we set a suitable in vitro experiment revealing that the treatment with MAP3K8 inhibitor restored the effect of vemurafenib in terms of both DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage (apoptosis) in thyroid cancer stem cells. Moreover, MAP3K8 expression levels may be a useful marker to predict the response to vemurafenib.",

    "synopsis": "Lysogens are bacterial cells that have survived after genomically incorporating the DNA of temperate bacteriophages infecting them. If an infection results in lysogeny, the lysogen continues to grow and divide normally, seemingly unaffected by the integrated viral genome known as a prophage. However, the prophage can still have an impact on the host's phenotype and overall fitness in certain environments. Additionally, the prophage within the lysogen can activate the lytic pathway via spontaneous prophage induction (SPI), killing the lysogen and releasing new progeny phages. These new phages can then lyse or lysogenize other susceptible nonlysogens, thereby impacting the competition between lysogens and nonlysogens. In a scenario with differing growth rates, it is not clear whether SPI would be beneficial or detrimental to the lysogens since it kills the host cell but also attacks nonlysogenic competitors, either lysing or lysogenizing them. Here we study the evolutionary dynamics of a mixture of lysogens and nonlysogens and derive general conditions on SPI rates for lysogens to displace nonlysogens. We show that there exists an optimal SPI rate for bacteriophage \u03bb and explain why it is so low. We also investigate the impact of stochasticity and conclude that even at low cell numbers SPI can still provide an advantage to the lysogens. These results corroborate recent experimental studies showing that lower SPI rates are advantageous for phage-phage competition, and establish theoretical bounds on the SPI rate in terms of ecological and environmental variables associated with lysogens having a competitive advantage over their nonlysogenic counterparts.",

    "synopsis": "Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) causes chronic infection for which there is no cure or neutralising vaccine. HTLV-I has been clinically linked to the development of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive blood cancer, and HAM/TSP, a progressive neurological and inflammatory disease. Infected individuals typically mount a large, persistently activated CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against HTLV-I-infected cells, but ultimately fail to effectively eliminate the virus. Moreover, the identification of determinants to disease manifestation has thus far been elusive. A key issue in current HTLV-I research is to better understand the dynamic interaction between persistent infection by HTLV-I and virus-specific host immunity. Recent experimental hypotheses for the persistence of HTLV-I in vivo have led to the development of mathematical models illuminating the balance between proviral latency and activation in the target cell population. We investigate the role of a constantly changing anti-viral immune environment acting in response to the effects of infected T-cell activation and subsequent viral expression. The resulting model is a four-dimensional, non-linear system of ordinary differential equations that describes the dynamic interactions among viral expression, infected target cell activation, and the HTLV-I-specific CTL response. The global dynamics of the model is established through the construction of appropriate Lyapunov functions. Examining the particular roles of viral expression and host immunity during the chronic phase of HTLV-I infection offers important insights regarding the evolution of viral persistence and proposes a hypothesis for pathogenesis.",

These have led to the development of important methods for cancer therapy including virotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and many others. Along with this, there have also been some developments on analytical and computational models to help provide insights into clinical observations. This work develops a new mathematical model that combines important interactions between tumor cells and cells in the immune systems including natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells combined with drug delivery to these cell sites. These interactions are described via a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved numerically. A stability analysis of this model is also performed to determine conditions for tumor-free equilibrium to be stable. We also study the influence of proliferation rates and drug interventions in the dynamics of all the cells involved. Another contribution is the development of a novel parameter estimation methodology to determine optimal parameters in the model that can reproduce a given dataset. Our results seem to suggest that the model employed is a robust candidate for studying the dynamics of tumor cells and it helps to provide the dynamic interactions between the tumor cells, immune system, and drug-response systems.",

Our results reveal how the strength of virus antagonism, and the time scale over which it acts to thwart the innate immune response, differs significantly between the two viruses, as is made clear by their impact on the temporal behavior of a number of measured genes. The model thus sheds light on the mechanisms that underlie the variability of innate immune responses to different H1N1 viruses.",

In contrast high levels of cholesterol in the blood are known to be a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. We formulate a deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equation model of the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) cholesterol genetic regulatory pathway in a hepatocyte. The mathematical model includes a description of genetic transcription by SREBP-2 which is subsequently translated to mRNA leading to the formation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a main regulator of cholesterol synthesis. Cholesterol synthesis subsequently leads to the regulation of SREBP-2 via a negative feedback formulation. Parameterised with data from the literature, the model is used to understand how SREBP-2 transcription and regulation affects cellular cholesterol concentration. Model stability analysis shows that the only positive steady-state of the system exhibits purely oscillatory, damped oscillatory or monotic behaviour under certain parameter conditions. In light of our findings we postulate how cholesterol homeostasis is maintained within the cell and the advantages of our model formulation are discussed with respect to other models of genetic regulation within the literature.",

This is done by turning rest states into periodic oscillations, and periodic oscillations into quasiperiodic oscillations. Strong perturbations result in complex periodic oscillations and even in chaos. Circadian rhythms would then result in a NF-\u03baB dynamics that is more complex than the simple oscillations and rest states, initially reported for this model. This renders it more amenable for information coding.",

    "synopsis": "We consider a three-state model comprising tumor cells, effector cells, and tumor-detecting cells under the influence of noises. It is demonstrated that inevitable stochastic forces existing in all three cell species are able to suppress tumor cell growth completely. Whereas the deterministic model does not reveal a stable tumor-free state, the auto-correlated noise combined with cross-correlation functions can either lead to tumor-dormant states, tumor progression, as well as to an elimination of tumor cells. The auto-correlation function exhibits a finite correlation time \u03c4, while the cross-correlation functions shows a white-noise behavior. The evolution of each of the three kinds of cells leads to a multiplicative noise coupling. The model is investigated by means of a multivariate Fokker-Planck equation for small \u03c4. The different behavior of the system is, above all, determined by the variation of the correlation time and the strength of the cross-correlation between tumor and tumor-detecting cells. The theoretical model is based on a biological background discussed in detail, and the results are tested using realistic parameters from experimental observations.",

    "synopsis": "The aim of this study was to create a dynamic mathematical model of the development of the cellular branch of the intestinal immune system of poultry during the first 42 days of life and of its response towards an oral infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The system elements were grouped in five important classes consisting of intra- and extracellular S. Enteritidis bacteria, macrophages, CD4+, and CD8+ cells. Twelve model variables were described by ordinary differential equations, including 50 parameters. Parameter values were estimated from literature or from own immunohistochemistry data. The model described the immune development in non-infected birds with an average R\u00b2 of 0.87. The model showed less accuracy in reproducing the immune response to S. Enteritidis infection, with an average R\u00b2 of 0.51, although model response did follow observed trends in time. Evaluation of the model against independent data derived from several infection trials showed strong/significant deviations from observed values. Nevertheless, it was shown that the model could be used to simulate the effect of varying input parameters on system elements response, such as the number of immune cells at hatch. Model simulations allowed one to study the sensitivity of the model outcome for varying model inputs. The initial number of immune cells at hatch was shown to have a profound impact on the predicted development in the number of systemic S. Enteritidis bacteria after infection. The theoretical contribution of this work is the identification of responses in system elements of the developing intestinal immune system of poultry obtaining a mathematical representation which allows one to explore the relationships between these elements under contrasting environmental conditions during different stages of intestinal development.",

    "synopsis": "One of the most important questions in cell biology is how cells cope with rapid changes in their environment. The range of common molecular responses includes a dramatic change in the pattern of gene expression and the elevated synthesis of so-called heat shock (or stress) proteins (HSPs). Induction of HSPs increases cell survival under stress conditions [Morimoto, R.I., 1993. Cells in stress: transcriptional activation of heat shock genes. Science 259, 1409-1410]. In this paper we propose a mathematical model of heat shock protein synthesis induced by an external temperature stimulus. Our model consists of a system of nine nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of the key variables involved in the regulation of HSP synthesis. Computational simulations of our model are carried out for different external temperature stimuli. We compare our model predictions with experimental data for three different cases-one corresponding to heat shock, the second corresponding to slow heating conditions and the third corresponding to a short heat shock (lasting about 40 min). We also present our model predictions for heat shocks carried out up to different final temperatures and finally we present a new hypothesis concerning the molecular response to stress that explains some phenomena observed in experiments.",

Our aim is to establish the treatment regimens that maximize the effector cell count and minimize the tumor cell burden and the deleterious effects of the total amount of drugs. We derive the existence of an optimal control by using the boundedness of solutions. We characterize the optimality system, in which the state system is coupled with co-states.

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND:The haematopoietic lineages with leukaemia lineages are considered in this paper. In particular, we mainly consider that haematopoietic lineages are tightly controlled by negative feedback inhibition of end-product. Actually, leukemia has been found 100 years ago. Up to now, the exact mechanism is still unknown, and many factors are thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. Nevertheless, it is very necessary to continue the profound study of the pathogenesis of leukemia. Here, we propose a new mathematical model which include some negative feedback inhibition from the terminally differentiated cells of haematopoietic lineages to the haematopoietic stem cells and haematopoietic progenitor cells in order to describe the regulatory mechanisms mentioned above by a set of ordinary differential equations. Afterwards, we carried out detailed dynamical bifurcation analysis of the model, and obtained some meaningful results. RESULTS:In this work, we mainly perform the analysis of the mathematic model by bifurcation theory and numerical simulations. We have not only incorporated some new negative feedback mechanisms to the existing model, but also constructed our own model by using the modeling method of stem cell theory with probability method. Through a series of qualitative analysis and numerical simulations, we obtain that the weak negative feedback for differentiation probability is conducive to the cure of leukemia. However, with the strengthening of negative feedback, leukemia will be more difficult to be cured, and even induce death. In contrast, strong negative feedback for differentiation rate of progenitor cells can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS:These results demonstrate that healthy progenitor cells are bestowed a competitive advantage over leukaemia stem cells. Weak g1, g2, and h1 enable the system stays in the healthy state. However, strong h2 can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia.",

    "synopsis": "Rho GTPases function as molecular switches in many different signaling pathways and control a wide range of cellular processes. Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) regulate Rho GTPase signaling and can function as both negative and positive regulators. The role of RhoGDIs as negative regulators of Rho GTPase signaling has been extensively investigated; however, little is known about how RhoGDIs act as positive regulators. Furthermore, it is unclear how this opposing role of GDIs influences the Rho GTPase cycle. We constructed ordinary differential equation models of the Rho GTPase cycle in which RhoGDIs inhibit the regulatory activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) by interacting with them directly as well as by sequestering the Rho GTPases. Using this model, we analyzed the role of RhoGDIs in Rho GTPase signaling.The model constructed in this study showed that the functions of GEFs and GAPs are integrated into Rho GTPase signaling through the interactions of these regulators with GDIs, and that the negative role of GDIs is to suppress the overall Rho activity by inhibiting GEFs. Furthermore, the positive role of GDIs is to sustain Rho activation by inhibiting GAPs under certain conditions. The interconversion between transient and sustained Rho activation occurs mainly through changes in the affinities of GDIs to GAPs and the concentrations of GAPs.RhoGDIs positively regulate Rho GTPase signaling primarily by interacting with GAPs and may participate in the switching between transient and sustained signals of the Rho GTPases. These findings enhance our understanding of the physiological roles of RhoGDIs and Rho GTPase signaling.",

Here, we show that a mathematical model of the macronutrient flux balances can capture the long-term dynamics of human weight change; all previous models are special cases of this model. We show that the generic dynamic behavior of body composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the first class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely. In the second class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible states. Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy expenditure can give identical responses in both model classes, and existing data are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities. Nevertheless, this distinction has important implications for the efficacy of clinical interventions that alter body composition and mass.",

A successful design of virus needs a full understanding about how viral and host parameters influence the tumor load.

Thresholds for viral treatment and virus-specific CTL response are obtained. Different protocols are given depending on the thresholds.

    "synopsis": "All cells and organisms exhibit stress-coping mechanisms to ensure survival. Cytoplasmic protein-RNA assemblies termed stress granules are increasingly recognized to promote cellular survival under stress. Thus, they might represent tumor vulnerabilities that are currently poorly explored. The translation-inhibitory eIF2\u03b1 kinases are established as main drivers of stress granule assembly. Using a systems approach, we identify the translation enhancers PI3K and MAPK/p38 as pro-stress-granule-kinases. They act through the metabolic master regulator mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) to promote stress granule assembly. When highly active, PI3K is the main driver of stress granules; however, the impact of p38 becomes apparent as PI3K activity declines. PI3K and p38 thus act in a hierarchical manner to drive mTORC1 activity and stress granule assembly. Of note, this signaling hierarchy is also present in human breast cancer tissue. Importantly, only the recognition of the PI3K-p38 hierarchy under stress enabled the discovery of p38's role in stress granule formation. In summary, we assign a new pro-survival function to the key oncogenic kinases PI3K and p38, as they hierarchically promote stress granule formation.",

At low antigen presentation, a progressive tumour growth takes place to the highest possible value. At high antigen presentation, there is a decrease in tumour size to some value when the dynamical equilibrium between the tumour and the immune system is reached. In the case of the medium antigen presentation, both these regimes can be realized depending on the initial tumour size and the condition of the immune system. A pronounced immunomodulating effect (the suppression of tumour growth and the normalization of IL-2 concentration) is established by considering the influence of low-intensity electromagnetic microwaves as a parametric perturbation of the dynamical system. This finding is in qualitative agreement with the recent experimental results on immunocorrective effects of centimetre electromagnetic waves in tumour-bearing mice.\r\n\r\nVolume 10, Issue 3, Pages 185-201",

    "synopsis": "A B S T R A C T \r\nThe trajectories of the dynamic system which regulates the competition between the populations of malignant cells and immune cells may tend to an asymptotically stable equilibrium in which the sizes of these populations do not vary, which is called tumor dormancy. Especially for lower steady-state sizes of the population of malignant cells, this equilibrium represents a desirable clinical condition since the tumor growth is blocked. In this context, it is of mandatory importance to analyze the robustness of this clinical favorable state of health in the face of perturbations. To this end, the paper presents an optimization technique to determine whether an assigned rectangular region, which surrounds an asymptotically stable equilibrium point of a quadratic systems, is included into the domain of attraction of the equilibrium itself. The biological relevance of the application of this technique to the analysis of tumor growth dynamics is shown on the basis of a recent quadraticmodel of the tumor\u2013immune system competition dynamics. Indeed the application of the proposedmethodology allows to ensure that a given safety region, determined on the basis of clinical considerations, belongs to the domain of attraction of the tumor blocked equilibrium; therefore for the set of perturbed initial conditions which belong to such region, the convergence to the healthy steady state is guaranteed. The proposed methodology can also provide an optimal strategy for cancer treatment.",

In this paper, we have developed a population semi-mechanistic model able to characterize the mechanisms implied in tumour growth dynamic after the administration of CyaA-E7, a vaccine able to target antigen to dendritic cells, thus triggering a potent immune response. The mathematical model developed presented the following main components: (1) tumour progression in the animals without treatment was described with a linear model, (2) vaccine effects were modelled assuming that vaccine triggers a non-instantaneous immune response inducing cell death. Delayed response was described with a series of two transit compartments, (3) a resistance effect decreasing vaccine efficiency was also incorporated through a regulator compartment dependent upon tumour size, and (4) a mixture model at the level of the elimination of the induced signal vaccine (k 2) to model tumour relapse after treatment, observed in a small percentage of animals (15.6%). The proposed model structure was successfully applied to describe antitumor effect of IL-12, suggesting its applicability to different immune-stimulatory therapies. In addition, a simulation exercise to evaluate in silico the impact on tumour size of possible combination therapies has been shown. This type of mathematical approaches may be helpful to maximize the information obtained from experiments in mice, reducing the number of animals and the cost of developing new antitumor immunotherapies.",

Although substantial studies have been conducted theoretically and experimentally in recent years, it is still a challenge to explore the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression. The investigation for these problems is very important for the diagnosis of cancer diseases and development of treatment schemes. RESULTS:To accurately describe the process of cancer initiation, we propose a new concept of gene initial mutation rate based on our recently designed mathematical model using the non-constant mutation rate. Unlike the widely-used average gene mutation rate that depends on the number of mutations, the gene initial mutation rate can be used to describe the initiation process of a single patient. In addition, we propose the instantaneous tumour doubling time that is a continuous function of time based on the non-constant mutation rate. Our proposed concepts are supported by the clinic data of seven patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The regression results suggest that, compared with the average mutation rate, the estimated initial mutation rate has a larger value of correlation coefficient with the patient survival time. We also provide the estimated tumour size of these seven patients over time. CONCLUSIONS:The proposed concepts can be used to describe the cancer initiation and progression for different patients more accurately. Since a quantitative understanding of cancer progression is important for clinical treatment, our proposed model and calculated results may provide insights into the development of treatment schemes and also have other clinic implications.",

The model consists of 5 pools, in which changes of the fractions of dose are given by a system of 5 ordinary differential equations. After i.v. administration of [3H]cortisol to 8 multiple pituitary deficient (MPD) patients (group I) the urines from each patient were collected in 9-15 portions during the following 3 days. From the urinary data the rate constants of cortisol metabolism were calculated. A published set of urinary data from patients with a normal cortisol metabolism (group II) was used for comparison. The overall half-life of the label in the circulation was 30 min for both groups; the half-life of the label excretion by both groups was 6 h and the time of maximal activity in the main metabolizing pool was 1.8 h in group I and 1.5 h in group II. The 20% of normal cortisol production rate (CPR) in the 8 MPD patients amounted to 7.2 +/- 1.9 mumol/(m2*d). Therefore, the low CPR but normal rate constants, i.e. a normal metabolic clearance rate of cortisol, in the MPD patients suggest a sensitive adjustment of the cortisol response in the target organs.",

    "synopsis": "A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves averaging properties such as firing rates across neurons in each population. The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes ;;flip-flop'' behavior, with most time spent in 2 stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less distinguishable, as in narcolepsy. The model behavior is robust across the constrained parameter ranges, but with sufficient flexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.",

Here we reconcile these results and show that whereas many commonly used cell lines do not exhibit a G1 R, primary fibroblasts have a G1\u00a0R that is defined by a precise Cdk activity threshold and the activation of cell-cycle-dependent transcription. A simple threshold model, based solely on Cdk activity, predicted with more than 95% accuracy whether individual cells\u00a0had passed R.

The dynamics is multi-stable and equilibria and their stability will be investigated depending on the parameter v.

Here, we present a general, four-component model of the immune system's response to a Staphylococcal aureus (S. aureus) infection, using ordinary differential equations. To incorporate both the infection and the immune system, we adopt the style of compartmenting the system to include bacterial dynamics, damage and inflammation to the host, and the host response. We incorporate interactions not previously represented including cross-talk between inflammation/damage and the infection and the suppression of the anti-inflammatory pathway in response to inflammation/damage. As a result, the most relevant equilibrium of the system, representing the health state, is an all-positive basal level. The model is able to capture eight different experimental outcomes for mice challenged with intratibial osteomyelitis due to S. aureus, primarily involving immunomodulation and vaccine therapies. For further validation and parameter exploration, we perform a parameter sensitivity analysis which suggests that the model is very stable with respect to variations in parameters, indicates potential immunomodulation strategies and provides a possible explanation for the difference in immune potential for different mouse strains.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: This work focuses on the computational modelling of osteomyelitis, a bone pathology caused by bacteria infection (mostly Staphylococcus aureus). The infection alters the RANK/RANKL/OPG signalling dynamics that regulates osteoblasts and osteoclasts behaviour in bone remodelling, i.e. the resorption and mineralization activity. The infection rapidly leads to severe bone loss, necrosis of the affected portion, and it may even spread to other parts of the body. On the other hand, osteoporosis is not a bacterial infection but similarly is a defective bone pathology arising due to imbalances in the RANK/RANKL/OPG molecular pathway, and due to the progressive weakening of bone structure. RESULTS: Since both osteoporosis and osteomyelitis cause loss of bone mass, we focused on comparing the dynamics of these diseases by means of computational models. Firstly, we performed meta-analysis on a gene expression data of normal, osteoporotic and osteomyelitis bone conditions. We mainly focused on RANKL/OPG signalling, the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies and the NF-kB pathway. Using information from the gene expression data we estimated parameters for a novel model of osteoporosis and of osteomyelitis. Our models could be seen as a hybrid ODE and probabilistic verification modelling framework which aims at investigating the dynamics of the effects of the infection in bone remodelling. Finally we discuss different diagnostic estimators defined by formal verification techniques, in order to assess different bone pathologies (osteopenia, osteoporosis and osteomyelitis) in an effective way. CONCLUSIONS: We present a modeling framework able to reproduce aspects of the different bone remodeling defective dynamics of osteomyelitis and osteoporosis. We report that the verification-based estimators are meaningful in the light of a feed forward between computational medicine and clinical bioinformatics.",

The initial immune response plays a central role in determining the course and outcome of pneumococcal disease. We combine bacterial titer measurements from mice infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae with mathematical modeling to investigate the coordination of immune responses and the effects of initial inoculum on outcome. To evaluate the contributions of individual components, we systematically build a mathematical model from three subsystems that describe the succession of defensive cells in the lung: resident alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. The alveolar macrophage response, which can be modeled by a single differential equation, can by itself rapidly clear small initial numbers of pneumococci. Extending the model to include the neutrophil response required additional equations for recruitment cytokines and host cell status and damage. With these dynamics, two outcomes can be predicted: bacterial clearance or sustained bacterial growth. Finally, a model including monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment by neutrophils suggests that sustained bacterial growth is possible even in their presence. Our model quantifies the contributions of cytotoxicity and immune-mediated damage in pneumococcal pathogenesis.",

In a laboratory setting, its central role is reflected in thrombin evolution over time being used as a measure of the ability of a patient's blood to clot. Here, we present a model for the generation of thrombin (based on earlier work) and analyse it using the method of matched asymptotic expansions to derive a sequence of simplified models that characterize the roles of distinct interactions over various timescales. In particular, we are able through the asymptotic analysis to provide simplified models that are an excellent substitute for the full model (capturing the explosive growth and decay of thrombin) and approximations for the key experimental measurements used to describe thrombin's characteristic evolution over time. The asymptotic results are validated against numerical simulations.",

Indeed, the pro-tumor roles of the immune system - as suppliers of growth and pro-angiogenic factors or defenses against cytotoxic immune attacks, for example - have been long appreciated, but relatively few theoretical works have considered their effects. Inspired by the recently proposed \"immune-mediated\" theory of metastasis, we develop a mathematical model for tumor-immune interactions at two anatomically distant sites, which includes both anti- and pro-tumor immune effects, and the experimentally observed tumor-induced phenotypic plasticity of immune cells (tumor \"education\" of the immune cells). Upon confrontation of our model to experimental data, we use it to evaluate the implications of the immune-mediated theory of metastasis. We find that tumor education of immune cells may explain the relatively poor performance of immunotherapies, and that many metastatic phenomena, including metastatic blow-up, dormancy, and metastasis to sites of injury, can be explained by the immune-mediated theory of metastasis. Our results suggest that further work is warranted to fully elucidate the pro-tumor effects of the immune system in metastatic cancer.",

    "title": "Responses to auxin signals: an operating principle for dynamical sensitivity yet high resilience.",
    "synopsis": "Plants depend on the signalling of the phytohormone auxin for their development and for responding to environmental perturbations. The associated biomolecular signalling network involves a negative feedback on Aux/IAA proteins which mediate the influence of auxin (the signal) on the auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors (the drivers of the response). To probe the role of this feedback, we consider alternative in silico signalling networks implementing different operating principles. By a comparative analysis, we find that the presence of a negative feedback allows the system to have a far larger sensitivity in its dynamical response to auxin and that this sensitivity does not prevent the system from being highly resilient. Given this insight, we build a new biomolecular signalling model for quantitatively describing such Aux/IAA and ARF responses.",

    "synopsis": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease which causes pain and stiffness in joints. OA progresses through excessive degradation of joint cartilage, eventually leading to significant joint degeneration and loss of function. Cytokines, a group of cell signalling proteins, present in raised concentrations in OA joints, can be classified into pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory groups. They mediate cartilage degradation through several mechanisms, primarily the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of collagen-degrading enzymes. In this paper we show that the interactions of cytokines within cartilage have a crucial role to play in OA progression and treatment. We develop a four-variable ordinary differential equation model for the interactions between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, MMPs and fibronectin fragments (Fn-fs), a by-product of cartilage degradation and up-regulator of cytokines. We show that the model has four classes of dynamic behaviour: homoeostasis, bistable inflammation, tristable inflammation and persistent inflammation. We show that positive and negative feedbacks controlling cytokine production rates can determine either a pre-disposition to OA or initiation of OA. Further, we show that manipulation of cytokine, MMP and Fn-fs levels can be used to treat OA, but we suggest that multiple treatment targets may be essential to halt or slow disease progression.",

    "synopsis": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly types of cancer since it typically spreads rapidly and can seldom be detected in its early stage. Pancreatic cancer therapy is thus a challenging task, and appropriate prognosis or assessment for pancreatic cancer therapy is of critical importance. In this work, based on available clinical data in Niu et al. (2013) we develop a mathematical prognosis model that can predict the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients who receive immunotherapy. The mathematical model incorporates pancreatic cancer cells, pancreatic stellate cells, three major classes of immune effector cells CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, helper T cells, and two major classes of cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). The proposed model describes the dynamic interaction between tumor and immune cells. In order for the model to be able to generate appropriate prognostic results for disease progression, the distribution and stability properties of equilibria in the mathematical model are computed and analysed in absence of treatments. In addition, numerical simulations for disease progression with or without treatments are performed. It turns out that the median overall survival associated with CIK immunotherapy is prolonged from 7 to 13months compared with the survival without treatment, this is consistent with the clinical data observed in Niu et al. (2013). The validity of the proposed mathematical prognosis model is thus verified. Our study confirms that immunotherapy offers a better prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients. As a direct extension of this work, various new therapy methods that are under exploration and clinical trials could be assessed or evaluated using the newly developed mathematical prognosis model.",

    "synopsis": "Fertility critically depends on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator, a neural construct comprised of hypothalamic neurons coexpressing kisspeptin, neurokoinin-B and dynorphin. Here, using mathematical modeling and in vivo optogenetics we reveal for the first time how this neural construct initiates and sustains the appropriate ultradian frequency essential for reproduction. Prompted by mathematical modeling, we show experimentally using female estrous mice that robust pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone, a proxy for GnRH, emerges abruptly as we increase the basal activity of the neuronal network using continuous low-frequency optogenetic stimulation. Further increase in basal activity markedly increases pulse frequency and eventually leads to pulse termination. Additional model predictions that pulsatile dynamics emerge from nonlinear positive and negative feedback interactions mediated through neurokinin-B and dynorphin signaling respectively are confirmed neuropharmacologically. Our results shed light on the long-elusive GnRH pulse generator offering new horizons for reproductive health and wellbeing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator controls the pulsatile secretion of the gonadotropic hormones LH and FSH and is critical for fertility. The hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin neurons are thought to represent the GnRH pulse generator, since their oscillatory activity is coincident with LH pulses in the blood; a proxy for GnRH pulses. However, the mechanisms underlying GnRH pulse generation remain elusive. We developed a mathematical model of the kisspeptin neuronal network and confirmed its predictions experimentally, showing how LH secretion is frequency-modulated as we increase the basal activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons in vivo using continuous optogenetic stimulation. Our model provides a quantitative framework for understanding the reproductive neuroendocrine system and opens new horizons for fertility regulation.",

The system involves three differential equations and a single bilinear term. We specifically select parameters that are suitable for the biological scenario of biofilm oscillations. We perform computer simulations and a detailed analysis of the system including bifurcation analysis and quasi-steady-state approximation. We also discuss the feedback structure of the system and the correspondence of the simulations to biological observations. Our theoretical work suggests potential scenarios about the oscillatory behaviour of biofilms and also serves as an application of a previously described chemical oscillator to a biological system.",

It is known from numerical simulations that the corresponding three-dimensional system of ODEs has periodic solutions in certain parameter regimes. We prove the existence of a stable limit cycle and provide a detailed description on how the limit cycle is generated. The limit cycle corresponds to a relaxation oscillation of an auxiliary system, which is singularly perturbed and has the same orbits as the original model. The singular perturbation character of the auxiliary problem is caused by the occurrence of small Michaelis constants in the model. Essential pieces of the limit cycle of the auxiliary problem consist of segments of slow motion close to several branches of a two dimensional critical manifold which are connected by fast jumps. In addition, a new phenomenon of exchange of stability occurs at lines, where the branches of the two-dimensional critical manifold intersect. This novel type of relaxation oscillations is studied by combining standard results from geometric singular perturbation with several suitable blow-up transformations.",

    "synopsis": "Precise timing of cell division is achieved by coupling waves of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity with a transcriptional oscillator throughout cell cycle progression. Although details of transcription of cyclin genes are known, it is unclear which is the transcriptional cascade that modulates their expression in a timely fashion. Here, we demonstrate that a Clb/Cdk1-mediated regulation of the Fkh2 transcription factor synchronizes the temporal mitotic CLB expression in budding yeast. A simplified kinetic model of the cyclin/Cdk network predicts a linear cascade where a Clb/Cdk1-mediated regulation of an activator molecule drives CLB3 and CLB2 expression. Experimental validation highlights Fkh2 as modulator of CLB3 transcript levels, besides its role in regulating CLB2 expression. A Boolean model based on the minimal number of interactions needed to capture the information flow of the Clb/Cdk1 network supports the role of an activator molecule in the sequential activation, and oscillatory behavior, of mitotic Clb cyclins. This work illustrates how transcription and phosphorylation networks can be coupled by a Clb/Cdk1-mediated regulation that synchronizes them.",

    "synopsis": "The eukaryotic cell cycle is characterized by alternating oscillations in the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Successful completion of the cell cycle is dependent on the precise, temporally ordered appearance of these activities. A modest level of Cdk activity is sufficient to initiate DNA replication, but mitosis and APC activation require an elevated Cdk activity. In present-day eukaryotes, this temporal order is provided by a complex network of regulatory proteins that control both Cdk and APC activities via sharp thresholds, bistability, and time delays. Using simple computational models, we show here that these dynamical features of cell-cycle organization could emerge in a control system driven by a single Cdk/cyclin complex and APC wired in a negative-feedback loop. We show that ordered phosphorylation of cellular proteins could be explained by multisite phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and competition of substrates for interconverting kinase (Cdk) and phosphatase. In addition, the competition of APC substrates for ubiquitylation can create and maintain sustained oscillations in cyclin levels. We propose a sequence of models that gets closer and closer to a realistic model of cell-cycle control in yeast. Since these models lack the elaborate control mechanisms characteristic of modern eukaryotes, they suggest that bistability and time delay may have characterized eukaryotic cell divisions before the current cell-cycle control network evolved in all its complexity.",

    "synopsis": "After DNA damage, cells activate p53, a tumor suppressor gene, and select a cell fate (e.g., DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis). Recently, a p53 oscillatory behavior was observed following DNA damage. However, the relationship between this p53 oscillation and cell-fate selection is unclear. Here, we present a novel model of the DNA damage signaling pathway that includes p53 and whole cell cycle regulation and explore the relationship between p53 oscillation and cell fate selection. The simulation run without DNA damage qualitatively realized experimentally observed data from several cell cycle regulators, indicating that our model was biologically appropriate. Moreover, the comprehensive sensitivity analysis for the proposed model was implemented by changing the values of all kinetic parameters, which revealed that the cell cycle regulation system based on the proposed model has robustness on a fluctuation of reaction rate in each process. Simulations run with four different intensities of DNA damage, i.e. Low-damage, Medium-damage, High-damage, and Excess-damage, realized cell cycle arrest in all cases. Low-damage, Medium-damage, High-damage, and Excess-damage corresponded to the DNA damage caused by 100, 200, 400, and 800 J/m(2) doses of UV-irradiation, respectively, based on expression of p21, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle arrest. In simulations run with High-damage and Excess-damage, the length of the cell cycle arrest was shortened despite the severe DNA damage, and p53 began to oscillate. Cells initiated apoptosis and were killed at 400 and 800 J/m(2) doses of UV-irradiation, corresponding to High-damage and Excess-damage, respectively. Therefore, our model indicated that the oscillatory mode of p53 profoundly affects cell fate selection.",

We started by applying our network pharmacology model to predict synergistic drug combinations. Next, by utilizing kinome-wide drug-target profiles and gene expression data, we pinpointed a synergistic target interaction between Aurora B and ZAK kinase inhibition that led to enhanced growth inhibition and cytotoxicity, as validated by combinatorial siRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, and drug combination experiments. The mechanism of such a context-specific target interaction was elucidated using a dynamic simulation of MDA-MB-231 signaling network, suggesting a cross-talk between p53 and p38 pathways.

In the presence of sufficient amounts of growth factor, the skeleton model also passes from a stable steady state to sustained oscillations of the various cyclin/Cdk complexes. This transition corresponds to the switch from quiescence to cell proliferation. Sequential activation of the cyclin/Cdk complexes allows the ordered progression along the G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. The 5-variable model can also account for the existence of a restriction point in G1, and for endoreplication. Like the detailed model, it contains multiple oscillatory circuits and can display complex oscillatory behaviour such as quasi-periodic oscillations and chaos.

The regulatory core is controlled by two negative feedback loops (regulated by Mdm2 and Wip1) responsible for oscillations, and two antagonistic positive feedback loops (regulated by phosphatases Wip1 and PTEN) responsible for bistability. By means of bifurcation analysis of the deterministic approximation we capture the recurrent solutions (i.e., steady states and limit cycles) that delineate temporal responses of the stochastic system. Direct switching from the limit-cycle oscillations to the \"apoptotic\" steady state is enabled by the existence of a subcritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in which the limit cycle loses its stability by merging with an unstable invariant torus. Our analysis provides an explanation why cancer cell lines known to have vastly diverse expression levels of Wip1 and PTEN exhibit a broad spectrum of responses to DNA damage: from a fast transition to a high level of p53 killer (a p53 phosphoform which promotes commitment to apoptosis) in cells characterized by high PTEN and low Wip1 levels to long-lasting p53 level oscillations in cells having PTEN promoter methylated (as in, e.g., MCF-7 cell line).",

How Michaelis-Menten kinetics influences oscillatory behavior in enzyme systems is investigated in models for oscillations in the activity of phosphofructokinase (PFK) in glycolysis and of cyclin-dependent kinases in the cell cycle. The model for the PFK reaction is based on a product-activated allosteric enzyme reaction coupled to enzymatic degradation of the reaction product. The Michaelian nature of the product decay term markedly influences the period, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. Likewise, a model for oscillations of Cdc2 kinase in embryonic cell cycles based on Michaelis-Menten phosphorylation-dephosphorylation kinetics shows that the occurrence and amplitude of the oscillations strongly depend on the ultrasensitivity of the enzymatic cascade that controls the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase.",

Both cell lines were maintained well in the chip, verified by confocal microscopy and measurement of hepatic enzyme activity. We investigated the PK profile of paracetamol in the chip, and corresponding PK model was constructed, which was used to predict PK profiles for different chip design parameters. Simulation results implied that a larger absorption surface area and a higher metabolic capacity are required to reproduce the in vivo PK profile of paracetamol more accurately.

Blood samples were collected at baseline, after the 1-wk run-in period, and after each treatment and washout period. Two 24-h urine samples were collected at baseline and after each treatment period.Plasma AR concentrations and daily excretion of 2 urinary AR metabolites increased with increasing AR dose (P < 0.001). Recovery of urinary metabolites in 24-h samples decreased with increasing doses from approximately 90% to approximately 45% in the range tested. A one-compartment model with 2 absorption compartments with different lag times and absorption rate constants adequately predicted plasma AR concentrations at the end of each intervention period.Both plasma AR concentrations and urinary metabolites in 24-h samples showed a dose-response relation to increased AR intake, which strongly supports the hypothesis that ARs and their metabolites may be useful as biomarkers of whole-grain wheat and rye intakes.",

We find that in areas of low transmission, the reproductive number and the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans are most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate. In areas of high transmission, the reproductive number is again most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate, but the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans is most sensitive to the human recovery rate. This suggests strategies that target the mosquito biting rate (such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying) and those that target the human recovery rate (such as the prompt diagnosis and treatment of infectious individuals) can be successful in controlling malaria.",

We define the basic reproductive number, \u211b(0), and analyse the existence and stability of equilibrium points. We compute sensitivity indices of \u211b(0) and a reactivity index (that measures epidemicity) to parameters for baseline wet and dry season values. \u211b(0) is most sensitive to the mosquito biting and death rates. The reactivity index is most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate and the infectivity of hosts to vectors. Numerical simulations show that even with low equilibrium prevalence, increases in mosquito densities through higher rainfall, in the presence of vertical transmission, can result in large epidemics. This suggests that vertical transmission is an important factor in the size and persistence of RVF epidemics.",

    "synopsis": "Acidosis, a frequent complication of trauma and complex surgery, results from tissue hypoperfusion and IV resuscitation with acidic fluids. While acidosis is known to inhibit the function of distinct enzymatic reactions, its cumulative effect on the blood coagulation system is not fully understood. Here, we use computational modeling to test the hypothesis that acidosis delays and reduces the amount of thrombin generation in human blood plasma. Moreover, we investigate the sensitivity of different thrombin generation parameters to acidosis, both at the individual and population level.We used a kinetic model to simulate and analyze the generation of thrombin and thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), which were the end points of this study. Large groups of temporal thrombin and TAT trajectories were simulated and used to calculate quantitative parameters, such as clotting time (CT), thrombin peak time, maximum slope of the thrombin curve, thrombin peak height, area under the thrombin trajectory (AUC), and prothrombin time. The resulting samples of parameter values at different pH levels were compared to assess the acidosis-induced effects. To investigate intersubject variability, we parameterized the computational model using the data on clotting factor composition for 472 subjects from the Leiden Thrombophilia Study. To compare acidosis-induced relative parameter changes in individual (\"virtual\") subjects, we estimated the probabilities of relative change patterns by counting the pattern occurrences in our virtual subjects. Distribution overlaps for thrombin generation parameters at distinct pH levels were quantified using the Bhattacharyya coefficient.Acidosis in the range of pH 6.9 to 7.3 progressively increased CT, thrombin peak time, AUC, and prothrombin time, while decreasing maximum slope of the thrombin curve and thrombin peak height (P < 10). Acidosis delayed the onset and decreased the amount of TAT generation (P < 10). As a measure of intrasubject variability, maximum slope of the thrombin curve and CT displayed the largest and second-largest acidosis-induced relative changes, and AUC displayed the smallest relative changes among all thrombin generation parameters in our virtual subject group (1-sided 95% lower confidence limit on the fraction of subjects displaying the patterns, 0.99). As a measure of intersubject variability, the overlaps between the maximum slope of the thrombin curve distributions at acidotic pH levels with the maximum slope of the thrombin curve distribution at physiological pH level systematically exceeded analogous distribution overlaps for CT, thrombin peak time, and prothrombin time.Acidosis affected all quantitative parameters of thrombin and TAT generation. While maximum slope of the thrombin curve showed the highest sensitivity to acidosis at the individual-subject level, it may be outperformed by CT, thrombin peak time, and prothrombin time as an indicator of acidosis at the subject-group level.",

Thus, heat flow can inform on the energetic costs of cellular processes, which are largely unknown. Here, we have repurposed an isothermal calorimeter to measure heat flow between developing zebrafish embryos and the surrounding medium. Heat flow increased over time with cell number. Unexpectedly, a prominent oscillatory component of the heat flow, with periods matching the synchronous early reductive cleavage divisions, persisted even when DNA synthesis and mitosis were blocked by inhibitors. Instead, the heat flow oscillations were driven by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions catalyzed by the cell-cycle oscillator, the biochemical network controlling mitotic entry and exit. We propose that the high energetic cost of cell-cycle signaling reflects the significant thermodynamic burden of imposing accurate and robust timing on cell proliferation during development.",

    "synopsis": "After anaphase, the high mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity is downregulated to promote exit from mitosis. To this end, in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Net1. During anaphase, Cdk- and Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 is thought to release active Cdc14. How Net1 is phosphorylated specifically in anaphase, when mitotic kinase activity starts to decline, has remained unexplained. Here, we show that PP2A(Cdc55) phosphatase keeps Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase. The sister chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset, interacts with and downregulates PP2A(Cdc55), thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A(Cdc55) downregulation also promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the \"mitotic exit network\" that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines. These findings allow us to present a new quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast.",

    "synopsis": "Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/CCdh1 inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/CCdh1 bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/CCdh1 and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/CCdh1 bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/CCdh1. Our study builds a coherent framework and generates hypotheses that can be further explored by experiments.",

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020.

    "synopsis": "Tightly interlinked feedback regulators control the dynamics of intracellular responses elicited by the activation of signal transduction pathways. Interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1) orchestrates antiviral responses in hepatocytes, yet mechanisms that define pathway sensitization in response to prestimulation with different IFN\u03b1 doses remained unresolved. We establish, based on quantitative measurements obtained for the hepatoma cell line Huh7.5, an ordinary differential equation\u00a0model for IFN\u03b1 signal transduction that comprises the feedback regulators STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, USP18, SOCS1, SOCS3, and IRF2. The model-based analysis shows that, mediated by the signaling proteins STAT2 and IRF9, prestimulation with a low IFN\u03b1 dose hypersensitizes the pathway. In contrast, prestimulation with a high dose of IFN\u03b1 leads to a dose-dependent desensitization, mediated by the negative regulators USP18 and SOCS1 that act at the receptor. The analysis of basal protein abundance in primary human hepatocytes reveals high heterogeneity in patient-specific amounts of STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, and USP18. The mathematical modeling approach shows that the basal amount of USP18 determines patient-specific pathway desensitization, while the abundance of STAT2 predicts the patient-specific IFN\u03b1 signal response.",

    "synopsis": "This paper proposes a dynamic model to describe and forecast the dynamics of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 transmission. The model is based on an approach previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic. This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions.",

    "synopsis": "Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally. Although reperfusion following myocardial ischemia can prevent death by restoring nutrient flow, ischemia/reperfusion injury can cause significant heart damage. The mechanisms that drive ischemia/reperfusion injury are not well understood; currently, few methods can predict the state of the cardiac muscle cell and its metabolic conditions during ischemia. Here, we explored the energetic sustainability of cardiomyocytes, using a model for cellular metabolism to predict the levels of ATP following hypoxia. We modeled glycolytic metabolism with a system of coupled ordinary differential equations describing the individual metabolic reactions within the cardiomyocyte over time. Reduced oxygen levels and ATP consumption rates were simulated to characterize metabolite responses to ischemia. By tracking biochemical species within the cell, our model enables prediction of the cell's condition up to the moment of reperfusion. The simulations revealed a distinct transition between energetically sustainable and unsustainable ATP concentrations for various energetic demands. Our model illustrates how even low oxygen concentrations allow the cell to perform essential functions. We found that the oxygen level required for a sustainable level of ATP increases roughly linearly with the ATP consumption rate. An extracellular O2 concentration of \u223c0.007 mm could supply basic energy needs in non-beating cardiomyocytes, suggesting that increased collateral circulation may provide an important source of oxygen to sustain the cardiomyocyte during extended ischemia. Our model provides a time-dependent framework for studying various intervention strategies to change the outcome of reperfusion.",

    "synopsis": "Background:The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in China and more than 30 countries over last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods:We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. Results:The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R &gt; 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R &lt; 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. Conclusions:We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.

    "synopsis": "The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 20201-4. Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term &#39;shield immunity&#39; at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15.",

    "synopsis": "The properties of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells depend crucially on the agonist used to stimulate them. Acetylcholine or carbachol (CCh) cause high-frequency (10-12-s period) calcium oscillations that are superimposed on a raised baseline, while cholecystokinin (CCK) causes long-period (>100-s period) baseline spiking. We show that physiological concentrations of CCK induce rapid phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor, which is not true of physiological concentrations of CCh. Based on this and other experimental data, we construct a mathematical model of agonist-specific intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. Model simulations agree with previous experimental work on the rates of activation and inactivation of the IP3 receptor by calcium (DuFour, J.-F., I.M. Arias, and T.J. Turner. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272:2675-2681), and reproduce both short-period, raised baseline oscillations, and long-period baseline spiking. The steady state open probability curve of the model IP3 receptor is an increasing function of calcium concentration, as found for type-III IP3 receptors by Hagar et al. (Hagar, R.E., A.D. Burgstahler, M.H. Nathanson, and B.E. Ehrlich. 1998. Nature. 396:81-84). We use the model to predict the effect of the removal of external calcium, and this prediction is confirmed experimentally. We also predict that, for type-III IP3 receptors, the steady state open probability curve will shift to lower calcium concentrations as the background IP3 concentration increases. We conclude that the differences between CCh- and CCK-induced calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells can be explained by two principal mechanisms: (a) CCK causes more phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor than does CCh, and the phosphorylated receptor cannot pass calcium current; and (b) the rate of calcium ATPase pumping and the rate of calcium influx from the outside the cell are greater in the presence of CCh than in the presence of CCK.",

    "title": "Simulating in vitro transcriptional response of zinc homeostasis system in Escherichia coli.",
    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND: The zinc homeostasis system in Escherichia coli is one of the most intensively studied prokaryotic zinc homeostasis systems. Its underlying regulatory machine consists of repression on zinc influx through ZnuABC by Zur (Zn2+ uptake regulator) and activation on zinc efflux via ZntA by ZntR (a zinc-responsive regulator). Although these transcriptional regulations seem to be well characterized, and there is an abundance of detailed in vitro experimental data available, as yet there is no mathematical model to help interpret these data. To our knowledge, the work described here is the first attempt to use a mathematical model to simulate these regulatory relations and to help explain the in vitro experimental data. RESULTS: We develop a unified mathematical model consisting of 14 reactions to simulate the in vitro transcriptional response of the zinc homeostasis system in E. coli. Firstly, we simulate the in vitro Zur-DNA interaction by using two of these reactions, which are expressed as 4 ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By imposing the conservation restraints and solving the relevant steady state equations, we find that the simulated sigmoidal curve matches the corresponding experimental data. Secondly, by numerically solving the ODEs for simulating the Zur and ZntR run-off transcription experiments, and depicting the simulated concentrations of zntA and znuC transcripts as a function of free zinc concentration, we find that the simulated curves fit the corresponding in vitro experimental data. Moreover, we also perform simulations, after taking into consideration the competitive effects of ZntR with the zinc buffer, and depict the simulated concentration of zntA transcripts as a function of the total ZntR concentration, both in the presence and absence of Zn(II). The obtained simulation results are in general agreement with the corresponding experimental data. CONCLUSION: Simulation results show that our model can quantitatively reproduce the results of several of the in vitro experiments conducted by Outten CE and her colleagues. Our model provides a detailed insight into the dynamics of the regulatory system and also provides a general framework for simulating in vitro metal-binding and transcription experiments and interpreting the relevant experimental data.",

Using a simple mathematical model of the interacting population dynamics of HIV and its major host cell in the circulation (the CD4+ lymphocyte), predicted patterns of HIV plasma viraemia in the weeks following treatment with zidovudine are generated. These are in close agreement with observed patterns despite the fact that the model contains no mechanisms for the development of drug-resistant strains of virus. It is suggested that the patterns of viral abundance observed during the first 6 months after treatment may be the result of non-linearities in the interactions between HIV and CD4+ cells, and that it is only after the first post-treatment burst of viral production that drug resistance plays an important role.",

There has been much interest in understanding how IL-7 receptor signaling is modulated at multiple interconnected network levels. This review examines how the strength of the signal through the IL-7 receptor is modulated in T and B cells, including the use of shared receptor components, signaling crosstalk, shared interaction domains, feedback loops, integrated gene regulation, multimerization and ligand competition. We discuss how these network control mechanisms could integrate to govern the properties of IL-7R signaling in lymphocytes in health and disease. Analysis of IL-7 receptor signaling at a network level in a systematic manner will allow for a comprehensive approach to understanding the impact of multiple signaling pathways on lymphocyte biology.",

To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. A well-mixed &quot;susceptible exposed infectious recovered&quot; (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.",

    "synopsis": "Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.",

    "synopsis": "The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a na\u00efve, uninfected population. It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.",

    "synopsis": "The process of clustering of plasma membrane receptors in response to their agonist is the first step in signal transduction. The rate of the clustering process and the size of the clusters determine further cell responses. Here we aim to demonstrate that a simple 2-differential equation mathematical model is capable of quantitative description of the kinetics of 2D or 3D cluster formation in various processes. Three mathematical models based on mass action kinetics were considered and compared with each other by their ability to describe experimental data on GPVI or CR3 receptor clustering (2D) and albumin or platelet aggregation (3D) in response to activation. The models were able to successfully describe experimental data without losing accuracy after switching between complex and simple models. However, additional restrictions on parameter values are required to match a single set of parameters for the given experimental data. The extended clustering model captured several properties of the kinetics of cluster formation, such as the existence of only three typical steady states for this system: unclustered receptors, receptor dimers, and clusters. Therefore, a simple kinetic mass-action-law-based model could be utilized to adequately describe clustering in response to activation both in 2D and in 3D.",

    "synopsis": "An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R 0 of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.",

    "synopsis": "We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 mRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY and the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark (LD) cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per mRNA from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome.",

This completely wrong perception causes people to disregard the necessary protocols and engage in some misbehavior, such as routine socializing or holiday travel. These conditions will put double pressure on the medical staff and endanger the lives of many people around the world. In this research, we are interested in analyzing the existing data to predict the number of infected people in the second wave of out-breaking COVID-19 in Iran. For this purpose, a model is proposed. The mathematical analysis corresponded to the model is also included in this paper. Based on proposed numerical simulations, several scenarios of progress of COVID-19 corresponding to the second wave of the disease in the coming months, will be discussed. We predict that the second wave of will be most severe than the first one. From the results, improving the recovery rate of people with weak immune systems via appropriate medical incentives is resulted as one of the most effective prescriptions to prevent the widespread unbridled outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19.",

Due to absence of specific vaccine or therapy, non-pharmacological interventions including social distancing, contact tracing are essential to end the worldwide COVID-19. We propose a mathematical model that predicts the dynamics of COVID-19 in 17 provinces of India and the overall India. A complete scenario is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date, which in turn divulges the predicted inflection point and ending phase of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed model monitors the dynamics of six compartments, namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), infected (I), isolated infected (Iq ) and quarantined susceptible (Sq ), collectively expressed SARIIqSq . A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values and the sensitive parameters are estimated from the real data on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between uninfected and infected individuals by quarantined the susceptible individuals, can effectively reduce the basic reproduction number. Our model simulations demonstrate that the elimination of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is possible by combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing. Our predictions are based on real data with reasonable assumptions, whereas the accurate course of epidemic heavily depends on how and when quarantine, isolation and precautionary measures are enforced.",

    "synopsis": "The emergence and fast global spread of COVID-19 has presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vaccine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.",

    "synopsis": "BACKGROUND:In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (later named as COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. METHODS:A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (Rc), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio- Re(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. RESULTS:The estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS:To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in the mainland of China apart from Hubei province.",

    "synopsis": "The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model offers the simplest framework to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19, however, it does not factor in its early depleting trend observed during a lockdown. We modified the SIR model to specifically simulate the early depleting transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to better predict its temporal trend in Malaysia. The classical SIR model was fitted to observed total (I total), active (I) and removed (R) cases of COVID-19 before lockdown to estimate the basic reproduction number. Next, the model was modified with a partial time-varying force of infection, given by a proportionally depleting transmission coefficient, [Formula: see text] and a fractional term, z. The modified SIR model was then fitted to observed data over 6&#160;weeks during the lockdown. Model fitting and projection were validated using the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 was interrupted immediately by the lockdown. The modified SIR model projected the depleting temporal trends with lowest MAPE for I total, followed by I, I daily and R. During lockdown, the dynamics of COVID-19 depleted at a rate of 4.7% each day with a decreased capacity of 40%. For 7-day and 14-day projections, the modified SIR model accurately predicted I total, I and R. The depleting transmission dynamics for COVID-19 during lockdown can be accurately captured by time-varying SIR model. Projection generated based on observed data is useful for future planning and control of COVID-19.",

    "synopsis": "The main objective of this paper is to address the following question: are the containment measures imposed by most of the world governments effective and sufficient to stop the epidemic of COVID-19 beyond the lock-down period? In this paper, we propose a mathematical model which allows us to investigate and analyse this problem. We show by means of the reproductive number, ${&amp;#92;cal R}_0$ that the containment measures appear to have slowed the growth of the outbreak. Nevertheless, these measures remain only effective as long as a very large fraction of population, p, greater than the critical value $1-1/{&amp;#92;cal R}_0$ remains confined. Using French current data, we give some simulation experiments with five scenarios including: (i) the validation of model with p estimated to 93%, (ii) the study of the effectiveness of containment measures, (iii) the study of the effectiveness of the large-scale testing, (iv) the study of the social distancing and wearing masks measures and (v) the study taking into account the combination of the large-scale test of detection of infected individuals and the social distancing with linear progressive easing of restrictions. The latter scenario was shown to be effective at overcoming the outbreak if the transmission rate decreases to 75% and the number of tests of detection is multiplied by three. We also noticed that if the measures studied in our five scenarios are taken separately then the second wave might occur at least as far as the parameter values remain unchanged.",

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59\u2009769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients&#39; being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.",

The basic processes considered by the model are ligand-receptor binding, diffusion of receptors and ligand-receptor complexes in the plane of the membrane toward and away from coated pits, binding of ligand-receptor complexes to coated pit proteins, endocytosis of coated pit contents, degradation of ligand, and recycling of undegraded receptors. The model accounts quantitatively for a wide variety of kinetic data and makes new predictions about steady-state characteristics. We show that for homogeneous receptors the slope of the Scatchard plot is not necessarily constant but can have a positive or negative derivative, depending on the concentration of coated pit proteins and their reactivity. This finding suggests that binding data, which show linear and concave curves, might be explainable be a simple coated pit-related mechanism. Similarly the relationship between the x-intercept and the number of receptors is also affected by kinetic parameters controlling endocytosis. We briefly discuss these results in terms of possible mechanisms for the action of tumor promoters, the large variations in receptor number and affinity in the literature, and methods for quantitative characterization of parameters.",

    "synopsis": "Using standard systems biology methodologies a 14-compartment dynamic model was developed for the Corona virus epidemic. The model predicts that: (i) it will be impossible to limit lockdown intensity such that sufficient herd immunity develops for this epidemic to die down, (ii) the death toll from the SARS-CoV-2 virus decreases very strongly with increasing intensity of the lockdown, but (iii) the duration of the epidemic increases at first with that intensity and then decreases again, such that (iv) it may be best to begin with selecting a lockdown intensity beyond the intensity that leads to the maximum duration, (v) an intermittent lockdown strategy should also work and might be more acceptable socially and economically, (vi) an initially intensive but adaptive lockdown strategy should be most efficient, both in terms of its low number of casualties and shorter duration, (vii) such an adaptive lockdown strategy offers the advantage of being robust to unexpected imports of the virus, e.g. due to international travel, (viii) the eradication strategy may still be superior as it leads to even fewer deaths and a shorter period of economic downturn, but should have the adaptive strategy as backup in case of unexpected infection imports, (ix) earlier detection of infections is the most effective way in which the epidemic can be controlled, whilst waiting for vaccines.",

    "synopsis": "This work examines the impact of various non-pharmaceutical control measures (government and personal) on the population dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lagos, Nigeria, using an appropriately formulated mathematical model. Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we seek to develop a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of active cases in Lagos; we also estimate the basic reproduction number of the disease outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we show the effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.",

Alterations in the cellular response to TGFb are involved in severe human diseases. To understand how cells encode the extracellular input and transmit its information to elicit appropriate responses, we acquired quantitative time-resolved measurements of pathway activation at the single-cell level. We established dynamic time warping to quantitatively compare signaling dynamics of thousands of individual cells and described heterogeneous single-cell responses by mathematical modeling. Our combined experimental and theoretical study revealed that the response to a given dose of TGFb is determined cell specifically by the levels of defined signaling proteins. This heterogeneity in signaling protein expression leads to decomposition of cells into classes with qualitatively distinct signaling dynamics and phenotypic outcome. Negative feedback regulators promote heterogeneous signaling, as a SMAD7 knock-out specifically affected the signal duration in a subpopulation of cells. Taken together, we propose a quantitative framework that allows predicting and testing sources of cellular signaling heterogeneity.",

While the inducing cytokine signals and core transcription factors driving the differentiation towards Th17 lineage are well known, detailed mechanistic interactions between the key components are poorly understood.<h4>Results</h4>We develop an integrative modeling framework which combines RNA sequencing data with mathematical modeling and enables us to construct a mechanistic model for the core Th17 regulatory network in a data-driven manner.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show significant evidence, for instance, for inhibitory mechanisms between the transcription factors and reveal a previously unknown dependency between the dosage of the inducing cytokine TGF b and the expression of the master regulator of competing (induced) regulatory T cell lineage. Further, our experimental validation approves this dependency in Th17 polarizing conditions.",

Disruption of the circadian rhythms manifests to the host's health as metabolic syndromes, including obesity, diabetes, and elevated plasma glucose, eventually leading to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanism behind the relationship between circadian rhythms and metabolism. To start answering this question, we propose a semimechanistic mathematical model to study the effect of circadian disruption on hepatic gluconeogenesis in humans. Our model takes the light-dark cycle and feeding-fasting cycle as two environmental inputs that entrain the metabolic activity in the liver. The model was validated by comparison with data from mice and rat experimental studies. Formal sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted to elaborate on the driving forces for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, simulating the impact of Clock gene knockout suggests that modification to the local pathways tied most closely to the feeding-fasting rhythms may be the most efficient way to restore the disrupted glucose metabolism in liver.",

    "synopsis": "p53 is activated in response to events compromising the genetic integrity of a cell. Recent data show that p53 activity does not increase steadily with genetic damage but rather fluctuates in an oscillatory fashion. Theoretical studies suggest that oscillations can arise from a combination of positive and negative feedbacks or from a long negative feedback loop alone. Both negative and positive feedbacks are present in the p53/Mdm2 network, but it is not known what roles they play in the oscillatory response to DNA damage. We developed a mathematical model of p53 oscillations based on positive and negative feedbacks in the p53/Mdm2 network. According to the model, the system reacts to DNA damage by moving from a stable steady state into a region of stable limit cycles. Oscillations in the model are born with large amplitude, which guarantees an all-or-none response to damage. As p53 oscillates, damage is repaired and the system moves back to a stable steady state with low p53 activity. The model reproduces experimental data in quantitative detail. We suggest new experiments for dissecting the contributions of negative and positive feedbacks to the generation of oscillations.",

    "synopsis": "The two-receptor:one-transducer model (Leff, 1987) is here extended to analyze interactions between agonists displaying E[A] curves of different shapes, by incorporating slope factors into the separate and common parts of the transduction pathway. Interactions were modelled as the effect of one agonist, at fixed concentration, on the curve to the other. A variety of patterns of position and slope changes are predicted. These do not depend on the shape of the control curve, rather, they depend on the slope factors in the separate and common pathways. The following specific predictions are made: (1) when the common pathway is steep, curves undergo potentiation and flattening; (2) when the common pathway is flat, curves undergo right-shift and steepening; (3) when the common pathway is hyperbolic, curves undergo right-shift, with no slope change; (4) when the slope depends on the separate pathways, curves only undergo right-shift with no change in slope. The model provides a sound basis for classifying agonist interactions and for detecting additional, synergistic or antagonistic properties. This analysis indicates that methods based on dose-additivity or independence are less reliable for these purposes. The model provides a practical test, based on slope changes, to detect and quantify additional properties.",

However, results for solid tumours have been limited up to now, in part due to the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, which is able to inactivate CAR-T cell clones. In this paper we put forward a mathematical model describing the competition of CAR-T and tumour cells, taking into account their immunosuppressive capacity. Using the mathematical model, we show that the use of large numbers of CAR-T cells targetting the solid tumour antigens could overcome the immunosuppressive potential of cancer. To achieve such high levels of CAR-T cells we propose, and study computationally, the manufacture and injection of CAR-T cells targetting two antigens: CD19 and a tumour-associated antigen. We study in silico the resulting dynamics of the disease after the injection of this product and find that the expansion of the CAR-T cell population in the blood and lymphopoietic organs could lead to the massive production of an army of CAR-T cells targetting the solid tumour, and potentially overcoming its immune suppression capabilities. This strategy could benefit from the combination with PD-1 inhibitors and low tumour loads.

The genetic defect responsible for DMD has been known for over 25 years, yet at present there is neither cure nor effective treatment for DMD. During early disease onset, the mdx mouse has been validated as an animal model for DMD and use of this model has led to valuable but incomplete insights into the disease process. For example, immune cells are thought to be responsible for a significant portion of muscle cell death in the mdx mouse; however, the role and time course of the immune response in the dystrophic process have not been well described. In this paper we constructed a simple mathematical model to investigate the role of the immune response in muscle degeneration and subsequent regeneration in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our model suggests that the immune response contributes substantially to the muscle degeneration and regeneration processes. Furthermore, the analysis of the model predicts that the immune system response oscillates throughout the life of the mice, and the damaged fibers are never completely cleared.",

    "title": "Mathematical Modelling of Alternative Pathway of Complement System.",
    "synopsis": "The complement system (CS) is an integral part of innate immunity and can be activated via three different pathways. The alternative pathway (AP) has a central role in the function of the CS. The AP of complement system is implicated in several human disease pathologies. In the absence of triggers, the AP exists in a time-invariant resting state (physiological steady state). It is capable of rapid, potent and transient activation response upon challenge with a trigger. Previous models of AP have focused on the activation response. In order to understand the molecular machinery necessary for AP activation and regulation of a physiological steady state, we built parsimonious AP models using experimentally supported kinetic parameters. The models further allowed us to test quantitative roles played by negative and positive regulators of the pathway in order to test hypotheses regarding their mechanisms of action, thus providing more insight into the complex regulation of AP.",

    "synopsis": "Immunotherapy has gained great momentum with chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, in which patient's T lymphocytes are genetically manipulated to recognize tumor-specific antigens, increasing tumor elimination efficiency. In recent years, CAR-T cell immunotherapy for hematological malignancies achieved a great response rate in patients and is a very promising therapy for several other malignancies. Each new CAR design requires a preclinical proof-of-concept experiment using immunodeficient mouse models. The absence of a functional immune system in these mice makes them simple and suitable for use as mathematical models. In this work, we develop a three-population mathematical model to describe tumor response to CAR-T cell immunotherapy in immunodeficient mouse models, encompassing interactions between a non-solid tumor and CAR-T cells (effector and long-term memory). We account for several phenomena, such as tumor-induced immunosuppression, memory pool formation, and conversion of memory into effector CAR-T cells in the presence of new tumor cells. Individual donor and tumor specificities are considered uncertainties in the model parameters. Our model is able to reproduce several CAR-T cell immunotherapy scenarios, with different CAR receptors and tumor targets reported in the literature. We found that therapy effectiveness mostly depends on specific parameters such as the differentiation of effector to memory CAR-T cells, CAR-T cytotoxic capacity, tumor growth rate, and tumor-induced immunosuppression. In summary, our model can contribute to reducing and optimizing the number of in vivo experiments with in silico tests to select specific scenarios that could be tested in experimental research.

    "synopsis": "The innate immune response, particularly the interferon response, represents a first line of defence against viral infections. The interferon molecules produced from infected cells act through autocrine and paracrine signalling to turn host cells into an antiviral state. Although the molecular mechanisms of IFN signalling have been well characterized, how the interferon response collectively contribute to the regulation of host cells to stop or suppress viral infection during early infection remain unclear. Here, we use mathematical models to delineate the roles of the autocrine and the paracrine signalling, and show that their impacts on viral spread are dependent on how infection proceeds. In particular, we found that when infection is well-mixed, the paracrine signalling is not as effective; by contrast, when infection spreads in a spatial manner, a likely scenario during initial infection in tissue, the paracrine signalling can impede the spread of infection by decreasing the number of susceptible cells close to the site of infection. Furthermore, we argue that the interferon response can be seen as a parallel to population-level epidemic prevention strategies such as 'contact tracing' or 'ring vaccination'. Thus, our results here may have implications for the outbreak control at the population scale more broadly.",

    "title": "A tipping point in cancer-immune dynamics leads to divergent immunotherapy responses and hampers biomarker discovery.",
    "synopsis": "<h4>Background</h4>Predicting treatment response or survival of cancer patients remains challenging in immuno-oncology. Efforts to overcome these challenges focus, among others, on the discovery of new biomarkers. Despite advances in cellular and molecular approaches, only a limited number of candidate biomarkers eventually enter clinical practice.<h4>Methods</h4>A computational modeling approach based on ordinary differential equations was used to simulate the fundamental mechanisms that dictate tumor-immune dynamics and to investigate its implications on responses to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and patient survival. Using in silico biomarker discovery trials, we revealed fundamental principles that explain the diverging success rates of biomarker discovery programs.<h4>Results</h4>Our model shows that a tipping point-a sharp state transition between immune control and immune evasion-induces a strongly non-linear relationship between patient survival and both immunological and tumor-related parameters. In patients close to the tipping point, ICI therapy may lead to long-lasting survival benefits, whereas patients far from the tipping point may fail to benefit from these potent treatments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings have two important implications for clinical oncology. First, the apparent conundrum that ICI induces substantial benefits in some patients yet completely fails in others could be, to a large extent, explained by the presence of a tipping point. Second, predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy should ideally combine both immunological and tumor-related markers, as a patient's distance from the tipping point can typically not be reliably determined from solely one of these. The notion of a tipping point in cancer-immune dynamics helps to devise more accurate strategies to select appropriate treatments for patients with cancer.",

    "synopsis": "Changes in diet are heavily associated with high mortality rates in several types of cancer. In this paper, a new mathematical model of tumor cells growth is established to dynamically demonstrate the effects of abnormal cell progression on the cells affected by the tumor in terms of the immune system\u2019s functionality and normal cells\u2019 dynamic growth. This model is called the normal-tumor-immune-unhealthy diet model (NTIUNHDM) and governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. In the NTIUNHDM, there are three main populations normal cells, tumor cell and immune cells. The model is discussed analytically and numerically by utilizing a fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method. The dynamic behavior of the NTIUNHDM is discussed by analyzing the stability of the system at various equilibrium points and the Mathematica software is used to simulate the model. From analysis and simulation of the NTIUNHDM, it can be deduced that instability of the response stage, due to a weak immune system, is classified as one of the main reasons for the coexistence of abnormal cells and normal cells. Additionally, it is obvious that the NTIUNHDM has only one stable case when abnormal cells begin progressing into early stages of tumor cells such that the immune cells are generated once. Thus, early boosting of the immune system might contribute to reducing the risk of cancer.",

    "synopsis": "<h4>Background</h4>Metformin has been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes for over 60 years; however, its mechanism of pharmacological action is not fully clear. Different hypotheses exist regarding metformin distribution and redistribution mechanisms between plasma and erythrocytes/red blood cells (RBCs).<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to test the hypothesis that the metformin distribution between plasma and RBC occurs via concentration difference-driven passive transport and estimated transport rate coefficient values based on metformin concentration time series in plasma and RBCs from in vivo studies.<h4>Methods</h4>An ordinary differential equation (ODE) system with two compartments was used to describe diffusion-based passive transport between plasma and RBCs. Metformin concentration time series in plasma and RBCs of 35 individuals were used for metformin transport parametrization. Plasma concentration has been approximated by biexponential decline.<h4>Results</h4>A single passive transport coefficient, k\u00a0=\u00a00.044\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.014 (h<sup>-1</sup>), can be applied, describing the uptake and release transport rate versus the linear equation v\u00a0=\u00a0k \u00d7 (M<sub>pl</sub>\u00a0-\u00a0M<sub>RBC</sub>), where M<sub>pl</sub> is the metformin concentration in plasma and M<sub>RBC</sub> is the metformin concentration in RBCs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our research suggests that passive transport can explain metformin distribution dynamics between plasma and RBCs because transport speed is proportional to the metformin concentration difference and independent of the transport direction. Concentration difference-driven passive transport can explain the mechanism of faster metformin distribution to RBCs the first few hours after administration, and faster release and domination of the redistribution transport rate after metformin concentration in plasma becomes smaller than in RBCs.",

While the identification of an antigen as self/non-self is critically important, the dynamic features of antigen presentation may also determine the immune system's response. Here, we use a simple mathematical model of immune activation to explore the idea of antigen discrimination through dynamics. We propose that antigen presentation is coupled to two nodes, one regulatory and one effecting the immune response, through an incoherent feedforward loop and repressive feedback. This circuit would allow the immune system to effectively estimate the increase of antigens with respect to time, a key determinant of immune reactivity in\u00a0vivo. Our model makes the prediction that tumors growing at specific rates evade the immune system despite the continuous presence of antigens indicating disease, a phenomenon closely related to clinically observed \"two-zone tolerance.\" Finally, we discuss a plausible biological instantiation of our circuit using combinations of regulatory and effector T\u00a0cells.",

This treatment uses genetically engineered viruses which selectively infect, replicate in, and destroy cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Furthermore, current research and clinical trials have indicated that these viruses can be delivered as single agents or in combination with other therapies. In this paper, we propose systems of ordinary differential equations for modeling the dynamics of aggressive tumor growth under radiovirotherapy treatment. We divide the treatment period into two phases; consequently, we present two mathematical models. First, we formulate the virotherapy model as Phase I of the treatment. Then we extend the model to include radiotherapy in combination with virotherapy as Phase II of the treatment. Comprehensive qualitative analyses of both models are conducted. Furthermore, numerical experiments are performed in order to support the analytical results. An analysis of the parameters is also carried out to investigate their effects on the outcome of the treatment. Overall, the analytical results reveal that radiovirotherapy is more effective than, and a good alternative to, virotherapy, as it is capable of eradicating tumors completely.",

    "synopsis": "Advances in genetic engineering have paved the way for a new therapy for cancer, which is called virotherapy. This treatment uses genetically engineered viruses which selectively infect, replicate in, and destroy cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Furthermore, current research and clinical trials have indicated that these viruses can be delivered as single agents or in combination with other therapies. In this paper, we propose systems of ordinary differential equations for modeling the dynamics of aggressive tumor growth under radiovirotherapy treatment. We divide the treatment period into two phases; consequently, we present two mathematical models. First, we formulate the virotherapy model as Phase I of the treatment. Then we extend the model to include radiotherapy in combination with virotherapy as Phase II of the treatment. Comprehensive qualitative analyses of both models are conducted. Furthermore, numerical experiments are performed in order to support the analytical results. An analysis of the parameters is also carried out to investigate their effects on the outcome of the treatment. Overall, the analytical results reveal that radiovirotherapy is more effective than, and a good alternative to, virotherapy, as it is capable of eradicating tumors completely.",

    "synopsis": "The success of oncolytic virotherapies depends on the tumour microenvironment, which contains a large number of infiltrating immune cells. In this theoretical study, we derive an ODE model to investigate the interactions between breast cancer tumour cells, an oncolytic virus (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus), and tumour-infiltrating macrophages with different phenotypes which can impact the dynamics of oncolytic viruses. The complexity of the model requires a combined analytical-numerical approach to understand the transient and asymptotic dynamics of this model. We use this model to propose new biological hypotheses regarding the impact on tumour elimination/relapse/persistence of: (i) different macrophage polarisation/re-polarisation rates; (ii) different infection rates of macrophages and tumour cells with the oncolytic virus; (iii) different viral burst sizes for macrophages and tumour cells. We show that increasing the rate at which the oncolytic virus infects the tumour cells can delay tumour relapse and even eliminate tumour. Increasing the rate at which the oncolytic virus particles infect the macrophages can trigger transitions between steady-state dynamics and oscillatory dynamics, but it does not lead to tumour elimination unless the tumour infection rate is also very large. Moreover, we confirm numerically that a large tumour-induced M1\u2192M2 polarisation leads to fast tumour growth and fast relapse (if the tumour was reduced before by a strong anti-tumour immune and viral response). The increase in viral-induced M2\u2192M1 re-polarisation reduces temporarily the tumour size, but does not lead to tumour elimination. Finally, we show numerically that the tumour size is more sensitive to the production of viruses by the infected macrophages.",

    "synopsis": "Immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)-an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) used for anti tuberculosis immunization-is a clinically established procedure for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. However, the mode of action has not yet been fully elucidated, despite much extensive biological experience. The purpose of this paper is to develop a first mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions in the bladder as a result of BCG therapy. A mathematical analysis of the ODE model identifies multiple equilibrium points, their stability properties, and bifurcation points. Intriguing regimes of bistability are identified in which treatment has potential to result in a tumor-free equilibrium or a full-blown tumor depending only on initial conditions. Attention is given to estimating parameters and validating the model using published data taken from in vitro, mouse and human studies. The model makes clear that intensity of immunotherapy must be kept in limited bounds. While small treatment levels may fail to clear the tumor, a treatment that is too large can lead to an over-stimulated immune system having dangerous side effects for the patient.",

    "synopsis": "Cancer immunotherapy aims at eliciting an immune system response against the tumor. However, it is often characterized by toxic side-effects. Limiting the tumor growth and, concurrently, avoiding the toxicity of a drug, is the problem of protocol design. We formulate this question as an optimization problem and derive an algorithm for its solution. Unlike the standard optimal control approach, the algorithm simulates impulse-like drug administrations. It relies on an exact computation of the gradient of the cost function with respect to any protocol by means of the variational equations, that can be solved in parallel with the system. In comparison with previous versions of this method [F. Castiglione, B. Piccoli, Optimal control in a model of dendritic cell transfection cancer immunotherapy, Bull. Math. Biol. 68 (2006) 255-274; B. Piccoli, F. Castiglione, Optimal vaccine scheduling in cancer immunotherapy, Physica A. 370 (2) (2007) 672-680], we optimize both the timing and the dosage of each administration and introduce a penalty term to avoid clustering of subsequent injections, a requirement consistent with the clinical practice. In addition, we implement the optimization scheme to simulate the case of multi-therapies. The procedure works for any ODE system describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an arbitrary number of therapeutic agents. In this work, it was tested for a well known model of the tumor-immune system interaction [D. Kirschner, J.C. Panetta, Modeling immunotherapy of tumor-immune interaction, J. Math. Biol. 37 (1998) 235-252]. Exploring three immunotherapeutic scenarios (CTL therapy, IL-2 therapy and combined therapy), we display the stability and efficacy of the optimization method, obtaining protocols that are successful compromises between various clinical requirements.",

    "synopsis": "Metformin is the primary drug for type 2 diabetes treatment and a promising candidate for other disease treatment. It has significant deviations between individuals in therapy efficiency and pharmacokinetics, leading to the administration of an unnecessary overdose or an insufficient dose. There is a lack of data regarding the concentration-time profiles in various human tissues that limits the understanding of pharmacokinetics and hinders the development of precision therapies for individual patients. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed in this study is based on humans\u2019 known physiological parameters (blood flow, tissue volume, and others). The missing tissue-specific pharmacokinetics parameters are estimated by developing a PBPK model of metformin in mice where the concentration time series in various tissues have been measured. Some parameters are adapted from human intestine cell culture experiments. The resulting PBPK model for metformin in humans includes 21 tissues and body fluids compartments and can simulate metformin concentration in the stomach, small intestine, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle adipose, and brain depending on the body weight, dose, and administration regimen. Simulations for humans with a bodyweight of 70kg have been analyzed for doses in the range of 500-1500mg. Most tissues have a half-life (T1/2) similar to plasma (3.7h) except for the liver and intestine with shorter T1/2 and muscle, kidney, and red blood cells that have longer T1/2. The highest maximal concentrations (Cmax) turned out to be in the intestine (absorption process) and kidney (excretion process), followed by the liver. The developed metformin PBPK model for mice does not have a compartment for red blood cells and consists of 20 compartments. The developed human model can be personalized by adapting measurable values (tissue volumes, blood flow) and measuring metformin concentration time-course in blood and urine after a single dose of metformin. The personalized model can be used as a decision support tool for precision therapy development for individuals.",

    "synopsis": "<h4>Background</h4>Metformin has been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes for over 60 years; however, its mechanism of pharmacological action is not fully clear. Different hypotheses exist regarding metformin distribution and redistribution mechanisms between plasma and erythrocytes/red blood cells (RBCs).<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to test the hypothesis that the metformin distribution between plasma and RBC occurs via concentration difference-driven passive transport and estimated transport rate coefficient values based on metformin concentration time series in plasma and RBCs from in vivo studies.<h4>Methods</h4>An ordinary differential equation (ODE) system with two compartments was used to describe diffusion-based passive transport between plasma and RBCs. Metformin concentration time series in plasma and RBCs of 35 individuals were used for metformin transport parametrization. Plasma concentration has been approximated by biexponential decline.<h4>Results</h4>A single passive transport coefficient, k\u00a0=\u00a00.044\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.014 (h<sup>-1</sup>), can be applied, describing the uptake and release transport rate versus the linear equation v\u00a0=\u00a0k \u00d7 (M<sub>pl</sub>\u00a0-\u00a0M<sub>RBC</sub>), where M<sub>pl</sub> is the metformin concentration in plasma and M<sub>RBC</sub> is the metformin concentration in RBCs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our research suggests that passive transport can explain metformin distribution dynamics between plasma and RBCs because transport speed is proportional to the metformin concentration difference and independent of the transport direction. Concentration difference-driven passive transport can explain the mechanism of faster metformin distribution to RBCs the first few hours after administration, and faster release and domination of the redistribution transport rate after metformin concentration in plasma becomes smaller than in RBCs.",

    "synopsis": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a remarkably effective immunotherapy that relies on <i>in vivo</i> expansion of engineered CAR T cells, after lymphodepletion (LD) by chemotherapy. The quantitative laws underlying this expansion and subsequent tumour eradication remain unknown. We develop a mathematical model of T cell-tumour cell interactions and demonstrate that expansion can be explained by immune reconstitution dynamics after LD and competition among T cells. CAR T cells rapidly grow and engage tumour cells but experience an emerging growth rate disadvantage compared to normal T cells. Since tumour eradication is deterministically unstable in our model, we define cure as a stochastic event, which, even when likely, can occur at variable times. However, we show that variability in timing is largely determined by patient variability. While cure events impacted by these fluctuations occur early and are narrowly distributed, progression events occur late and are more widely distributed in time. We parameterized our model using population-level CAR T cell and tumour data over time and compare our predictions with progression-free survival rates. We find that therapy could be improved by optimizing the tumour-killing rate and the CAR T cells' ability to adapt, as quantified by their carrying capacity. Our tumour extinction model can be leveraged to examine why therapy works in some patients but not others, and to better understand the interplay of deterministic and stochastic effects on outcomes. For example, our model implies that LD before a second CAR T injection is necessary.",

    "synopsis": "Mathematical modelling has been used to study tumor-immune cell interaction. Some models were proposed to examine the effect of circulating lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, but they neglected the role of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells. Other models were constructed to study the role of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells but did not consider the role of other immune cells. In this study, we propose a mathematical model, in the form of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, that predicts the interaction between tumor cells and natural killer cells, CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, and circulating lymphocytes with or without immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy. This system is stiff, and the Runge-Kutta method failed to solve it. Consequently, the \"Adams predictor-corrector\" method is used. The results reveal that the patient's immune system can overcome small tumors; however, if the tumor is large, adoptive therapy with CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells can be an alternative to both CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell therapy and cytokines in some cases. Moreover, CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell therapy could replace chemotherapy depending upon tumor size. Even if a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is necessary, using CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell therapy can better reduce the dose of the associated chemotherapy compared to using combined CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and cytokine therapy. Stability analysis is performed for the studied patients. It has been found that all equilibrium points are unstable, and a condition for preventing tumor recurrence after treatment has been deduced. Finally, a bifurcation analysis is performed to study the effect of varying system parameters on the stability, and bifurcation points are specified. New equilibrium points are created or demolished at some bifurcation points, and stability is changed at some others. Hence, for systems turning to be stable, tumors can be eradicated without the possibility of recurrence. The proposed mathematical model provides a valuable tool for designing patients' treatment intervention strategies.",

A particular example is the adenovirus ONYX-015, which has entered clinical trials in the context of head and neck cancer. Successful therapy crucially requires an understanding about how viral and host parameters influence tumor load. The interactions between the growing tumor, the replicating virus, and possible immune responses are multifactorial and nonlinear. Hence, a complete understanding of how virus and host characteristics influence the outcome of therapy requires mathematical models. In this study, such mathematical models are presented and analyzed. The study investigates three possible scenarios that could be relevant for therapy: (a) viral cytotoxicity alone kills tumor cells; (b) a virus-specific lytic CTL response contributes to killing of infected tumor cells; (c) the virus elicits immunostimulatory signals within the tumor that promote the development of tumor-specific CTL. The models precisely define conditions required for successful therapy. They identify the parameters that need to be measured and modulated to evaluate and refine the existing therapy regimes.",

The idiosyncrasies of cell cycle regulation in particular organisms can be attributed, we claim, to specific settings of rate constants in the dynamic network of chemical reactions. The values of these rate constants are determined ultimately by the genetic makeup of an organism. To support these claims, we convert the reaction mechanism into a set of governing kinetic equations and provide parameter values (specific to budding yeast, fission yeast, frog eggs, and mammalian cells) that account for many curious features of cell cycle regulation in these organisms. Using one-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we show how overall cell growth drives progression through the cell cycle, how cell-size homeostasis can be achieved by two different strategies, and how mutations remodel bifurcation diagrams and create unusual cell-division phenotypes. The relation between gene dosage and phenotype can be summarized compactly in two-parameter bifurcation diagrams. Our approach provides a theoretical framework in which to understand both the universality and particularity of cell cycle regulation, and to construct, in modular fashion, increasingly complex models of the networks controlling cell growth and division.",

    "synopsis": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the focus of several investigations for design of newer drugs, as tuberculosis remains a major epidemic despite the availability of several drugs and a vaccine. Mycobacteria owe many of their unique qualities to mycolic acids, which are known to be important for their growth, survival, and pathogenicity. Mycolic acid biosynthesis has therefore been the focus of a number of biochemical and genetic studies. It also turns out to be the pathway inhibited by front-line anti-tubercular drugs such as isoniazid and ethionamide. Recent years have seen the emergence of systems-based methodologies that can be used to study microbial metabolism. Here, we seek to apply insights from flux balance analyses of the mycolic acid pathway (MAP) for the identification of anti-tubercular drug targets. We present a comprehensive model of mycolic acid synthesis in the pathogen M. tuberculosis involving 197 metabolites participating in 219 reactions catalysed by 28 proteins. Flux balance analysis (FBA) has been performed on the MAP model, which has provided insights into the metabolic capabilities of the pathway. In silico systematic gene deletions and inhibition of InhA by isoniazid, studied here, provide clues about proteins essential for the pathway and hence lead to a rational identification of possible drug targets. Feasibility studies using sequence analysis of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and human proteomes indicate that, apart from the known InhA, potential targets for anti-tubercular drug design are AccD3, Fas, FabH, Pks13, DesA1/2, and DesA3. Proteins identified as essential by FBA correlate well with those previously identified experimentally through transposon site hybridisation mutagenesis. This study demonstrates the application of FBA for rational identification of potential anti-tubercular drug targets, which can indeed be a general strategy in drug design. The targets, chosen based on the critical points in the pathway, form a ready shortlist for experimental testing.",

    "synopsis": "In many developing tissues, adjacent cells diverge in character so as to create a fine-grained pattern of cells in contrasting states of differentiation. It has been proposed that such patterns can be generated through lateral inhibition--a type of cell-cell interaction whereby a cell that adopts a particular fate inhibits its immediate neighbors from doing likewise. Lateral inhibition is well documented in flies, worms and vertebrates. In all of these organisms, the transmembrane proteins Notch and Delta (or their homologues) have been identified as mediators of the interaction--Notch as receptor, Delta as its ligand on adjacent cells. However, it is not clear under precisely what conditions the Delta-Notch mechanism of lateral inhibition can generate the observed types of pattern, or indeed whether this mechanism is capable of generating such patterns by itself. Here we construct and analyse a simple and general mathematical model of such contact-mediated lateral inhibition. In accordance with experimental data, the model postulates that receipt of inhibition (i.e. activation of Notch) diminished the ability to deliver inhibition (i.e. to produce active Delta). This gives rise to a feedback loop that can amplify differences between adjacent cells. We investigate the pattern-forming potential and temporal behaviour of this model both analytically and through numerical simulation. Inhomogeneities are self-amplifying and develop without need of any other machinery, provided the feedback is sufficiently strong. For a wide range of initial and boundary conditions, the model generates fine-grained patterns similar to those observed in living systems.",

In this paper, a new mathematical model of tumor cells growth is established to dynamically demonstrate the effects of abnormal cell progression on the cells affected by the tumor in terms of the immune system\u2019s functionality and normal cells\u2019 dynamic growth. This model is called the normal-tumor-immune-unhealthy diet model (NTIUNHDM) and governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. In the NTIUNHDM, there are three main populations normal cells, tumor cell and immune cells. The model is discussed analytically and numerically by utilizing a fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method. The dynamic behavior of the NTIUNHDM is discussed by analyzing the stability of the system at various equilibrium points and the Mathematica software is used to simulate the model. From analysis and simulation of the NTIUNHDM, it can be deduced that instability of the response stage, due to a weak immune system, is classified as one of the main reasons for the coexistence of abnormal cells and normal cells. Additionally, it is obvious that the NTIUNHDM has only one stable case when abnormal cells begin progressing into early stages of tumor cells such that the immune cells are generated once. Thus, early boosting of the immune system might contribute to reducing the risk of cancer.",

    "synopsis": "Biofilms are composed of microorganisms attached to a solid surface or floating on top of a liquid surface. They pose challenges in the field of medicine but can also have useful applications in industry. Regulation of biofilm growth is complex and still largely elusive. Oscillations are thought to be advantageous for biofilms to cope with nutrient starvation and chemical attacks. Recently, a minimal mathematical model has been employed to describe the oscillations in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. In this paper, we investigate four different modifications to that minimal model in order to better understand the oscillations in biofilms. Our first modification is towards making a gradient of metabolites from the center of the biofilm to the periphery. We find that it does not improve the model and is therefore, unnecessary. We then use realistic Michaelis-Menten kinetics to replace the highly simple mass-action kinetics for one of the reactions. Further, we use reversible reactions to mimic the diffusion in biofilms. As the final modification, we check the combined effect of using Michaelis-Menten kinetics and reversible reactions on the model behavior. We find that these two modifications alone or in combination improve the description of the biological scenario.",

    "synopsis": "During the hemostatic phase of wound healing, vascular injury leads to endothelial cell damage, initiation of a coagulation cascade involving platelets, and formation of a fibrin-rich clot. As this cascade culminates, activation of the protease thrombin occurs and soluble fibrinogen is converted into an insoluble polymerized fibrin network. Fibrin polymerization is critical for bleeding cessation and subsequent stages of wound healing. We develop a cooperative enzyme kinetics model for in vitro fibrin matrix polymerization capturing dynamic interactions among fibrinogen, thrombin, fibrin, and intermediate complexes. A tailored parameter subset selection technique is also developed to evaluate parameter identifiability for a representative data curve for fibrin accumulation in a short-duration in vitro polymerization experiment. Our approach is based on systematic analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the classical information matrix for simulations of accumulating fibrin matrix via optimization based on a least squares objective function. Results demonstrate robustness of our approach in that a significant reduction in objective function cost is achieved relative to a more ad hoc curve-fitting procedure. Capabilities of this approach to integrate non-overlapping subsets of the data to enhance the evaluation of parameter identifiability are also demonstrated. Unidentifiable reaction rate parameters are screened to determine whether individual reactions can be eliminated from the overall system while preserving the low objective cost. These findings demonstrate the high degree of information within a single fibrin accumulation curve, and a tailored model and parameter subset selection approach for improving optimization and reducing model complexity in the context of polymerization experiments.",

    "synopsis": "We have recently demonstrated that the rate-limiting enzymes in human glucose metabolism organize into cytoplasmic clusters to form a multienzyme complex, the glucosome, in at least three different sizes. Quantitative high-content imaging data support a hypothesis that the glucosome clusters regulate the direction of glucose flux between energy metabolism and building block biosynthesis in a cluster size-dependent manner. However, direct measurement of their functional contributions to cellular metabolism at subcellular levels has remained challenging. In this work, we develop a mathematical model using a system of ordinary differential equations, in which the association of the rate-limiting enzymes into multienzyme complexes is included as an essential element. We then demonstrate that our mathematical model provides a quantitative principle to simulate glucose flux at both subcellular and population levels in human cancer cells. Lastly, we use the model to simulate 2-deoxyglucose-mediated alteration of glucose flux in a population level based on subcellular high-content imaging data. Collectively, we introduce a new mathematical model for human glucose metabolism, which promotes our understanding of functional roles of differently sized multienzyme complexes in both single-cell and population levels.",

    "synopsis": "Haematopoiesis is the process of generation of blood cells. Lymphopoiesis generates lymphocytes, the cells in charge of the adaptive immune response. Disruptions of this process are associated with diseases like leukaemia, which is especially incident in children. The characteristics of self-regulation of this process make them suitable for a mathematical study. In this paper we develop mathematical models of lymphopoiesis using currently available data. We do this by drawing inspiration from existing structured models of cell lineage development and integrating them with paediatric bone marrow data, with special focus on regulatory mechanisms. A formal analysis of the models is carried out, giving steady states and their stability conditions. We use this analysis to obtain biologically relevant regions of the parameter space and to understand the dynamical behaviour of B-cell renovation. Finally, we use numerical simulations to obtain further insight into the influence of proliferation and maturation rates on the reconstitution of the cells in the B line. We conclude that a model including feedback regulation of cell proliferation represents a biologically plausible depiction for B-cell reconstitution in bone marrow. Research into haematological disorders could benefit from a precise dynamical description of B lymphopoiesis.",

The model equations are analyzed for negative, none and normal cooperativity using a specific version of bifurcation theory and they are solved numerically. Special attention is paid to the sign of so-called first Lyapunov value. Interpretations of the results are given, both according to dynamic theory and in biological terms. In terms of cell signaling, we propose the hypothesis that when the outgoing signal of a system spends a physiologically significant amount of time outside of its equilibrium state, then the value of that signal can be sampled at any point along the trajectory towards that equilibrium and indeed, at multiple points. Coupled with non-linear behavior, such as that caused by cooperativity, this feature can account for a complex and varied response, which p53 is known for. From dynamical point of view, we found that when cooperativity is negative, the system has only one stable equilibrium point. In the absence of cooperativity, there is a single unstable equilibrium point with a critical boundary of stability. In the case with normal cooperativity, the system can have one, two, or three steady states with both, bi-stability and bi-instability occurring.",

    "synopsis": "In 1996, Kim Nasmyth1 proposed that the eukaryotic cell cycle is an alternating sequence of transitions from G1 to S-G2-M and back again. These two phases correlate to high activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that trigger S-G2-M events and CDK antagonists that stabilize G1 phase. We associated these \"alternative phases\" with the coexistence of two stable steady states of the biochemical reactions among CDKs and their antagonists.2,3 Transitions between these steady states (G1-to-S and M-to-G1) are driven by \"helper\" proteins. The fact that the transitions are irreversible is guaranteed by a \"latching\" property of the molecular switches, as we have argued in previous publications.4,5 Here, we show that if the latch is broken, then the biochemical reactions can swing back-and-forth across the transitions; either G1-S-G1-S \u2026 (periodic DNA replication without mitosis or cell division) or M-(G1)-M-(G1) \u2026 (periodic Cdc14 release, without fully exiting mitosis). Using mathematical modeling of the molecular control circuit in budding yeast, we provide a fresh account of aberrant cell cycles in mutant strains: endoreplication in the clb1-5\u0394 strain6 and periodic release and resequestration of Cdc14 (an \"exit\" phosphatase) in the CLB2kd\u0394 strain.7,8 In our opinion, these \"endocycles\" are not autonomous oscillatory modules that must be entrained by the CDK oscillator6,7 but rather inadvertent and deleterious oscillations that are normally suppressed by the CDK latching-gate mechanism.8.",

The fact that a subgroup of the IAP family inhibits active caspases implies that not each caspase activation necessarily leads to apoptosis. In such a scenario, however, processed and enzymically active caspases should somehow be removed. Indeed, IAP-caspase complexes covalently bind ubiquitin, resulting in degradation by the 26S proteasome. Following release from mitochondria, IAP antagonists (e.g. second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac)) inactivate IAPs. Moreover, although pro-apoptotic factors such as irradiation or anti-cancer drugs may release Smac from mitochondria in tumor cells, high cytoplasmic survivin and ML-IAP levels might be able to neutralize it and, consequently, IAPs would further be able to bind activated caspases. Here, we propose a simple mathematical model, describing the molecular interactions between Smac deactivators, Smac, IAPs, and caspase-3, including the requirements for both induction and prevention of apoptosis, respectively. In addition, we predict a novel mechanism of caspase-3 degradation that might be particularly relevant in long-living cells.",

Its natural metabolic versatility and extraordinary ability to degrade environmental pollutants (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene) enable it to thrive under various harsh environmental conditions. Constraint-based metabolic models constructed from genome sequences enable quantitative insight into the central and specialized metabolism within a target organism. These genome-scale models have been utilized to understand, optimize, and design new strategies for improved bioprocesses. Reduced modeling approaches have been used to elucidate Nitrosomonas europaea metabolism at a pathway level. However, genome-scale knowledge about the simultaneous oxidation of ammonia and pollutant metabolism of N. europaea remains limited. Here, we describe the reconstruction, manual curation, and validation of the genome-scale metabolic model for N. europaea, iGC535. This reconstruction is the most accurate metabolic model for a nitrifying organism to date, reaching an average prediction accuracy of over 90% under several growth conditions. The manually curated model can predict phenotypes under chemolithotrophic and chemolithoorganotrophic conditions while oxidating methane and wastewater pollutants.

Target genes encoding enzymes that interact with the five essential metabolites finally selected were experimentally validated.

    "synopsis": "All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. In Drosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. This patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. Pair-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. This mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. In beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. In contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. Perhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. If so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. Here we suggest, using computer simulations, that the Drosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour.",

In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict ICB response by integrating genomic, molecular, demographic and clinical data from a comprehensively curated cohort (MSK-IMPACT) with 1,479 patients treated with ICB across 16 different cancer types. In a retrospective analysis, the model achieved high sensitivity and specificity in predicting clinical response to immunotherapy and predicted both overall survival and progression-free survival in the test data across different cancer types. Our model significantly outperformed predictions based on tumor mutational burden, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Additionally, the model provides quantitative assessments of the model features that are most salient for the predictions. We anticipate that this approach will substantially improve clinical decision-making in immunotherapy and inform future interventions.",

    "synopsis": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play a significant role in several biological processes. RNA-seq based transcriptome sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However, accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets. PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L<sub>1</sub> regularization and iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L<sub>1</sub> regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species. The performance of the tool was evaluated on 7 plant RNA-seq datasets using 10-fold cross-validation. The analysis exhibited superior accuracy when evaluated against currently available state-of-the-art CPC tools.",

    "synopsis": "Metagenomics is a culture-independent method for studying the microbes inhabiting a particular environment. Comparing the composition of samples (functionally/taxonomically), either from a longitudinal study or cross-sectional studies, can provide clues into how the microbiota has adapted to the environment. However, a recurring challenge, especially when comparing results between independent studies, is that key metadata about the sample and molecular methods used to extract and sequence the genetic material are often missing from sequence records, making it difficult to account for confounding factors. Nevertheless, these missing metadata may be found in the narrative of publications describing the research. Here, we describe a machine learning framework that automatically extracts essential metadata for a wide range of metagenomics studies from the literature contained in Europe PMC. This framework has enabled the extraction of metadata from 114,099 publications in Europe PMC, including 19,900 publications describing metagenomics studies in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and MGnify. Using this framework, a new metagenomics annotations pipeline was developed and integrated into Europe PMC to regularly enrich up-to-date ENA and MGnify metagenomics studies with metadata extracted from research articles. These metadata are now available for researchers to explore and retrieve in the MGnify and Europe PMC websites, as well as Europe PMC annotations API.",

Moreover, this study with other convolutional neural network architectures considering architecture complexity, reported accuracy, and running time with this framework and compare the accuracy of the models for blood cells detection.

    "synopsis": "Antibody design is valuable for therapeutic usage and biological research. Existing deep-learning-based methods encounter several key issues: 1) incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) generation; 2) incapability of capturing the entire 3D geometry of the input structure; 3) inefficient prediction of the CDR sequences in an autoregressive manner. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency and precision against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding CDR design, and binding affinity optimization. Specifically, the relative improvement to baselines is about 23% in antigen-binding CDR design and 34% for affinity optimization.",

    "synopsis": "Circadian rhythms are fundamental to life. In mammals, these rhythms are generated by pacemaker neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is remarkably consistent in structure and function between species, yet mammalian rest/activity patterns are extremely diverse, including diurnal, nocturnal, and crepuscular behaviors. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for this diversity: (i) modulation of SCN output by downstream nuclei, and (ii) direct effects of light on activity. These two mechanisms are difficult to disentangle experimentally and their respective roles remain unknown. To address this, we developed a computational model to simulate the two mechanisms and their influence on temporal niche. In our model, SCN output is relayed via the subparaventricular zone (SPZ) to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and thence to ventrolateral preoptic nuclei (VLPO) and lateral hypothalamus (LHA). Using this model, we generated rich phenotypes that closely resemble experimental data. Modulation of SCN output at the SPZ was found to generate a full spectrum of diurnal-to-nocturnal phenotypes. Intriguingly, we also uncovered a novel mechanism for crepuscular behavior: if DMH/VLPO and DMH/LHA projections act cooperatively, daily activity is unimodal, but if they act competitively, activity can become bimodal. In addition, we successfully reproduced diurnal/nocturnal switching in the rodent Octodon degu using coordinated inversions in both masking and circadian modulation. Finally, the model correctly predicted the SCN lesion phenotype in squirrel monkeys: loss of circadian rhythmicity and emergence of \u223c4-h sleep/wake cycles. In capturing these diverse phenotypes, the model provides a powerful new framework for understanding rest/activity patterns and relating them to underlying physiology. Given the ubiquitous effects of temporal organization on all aspects of animal behavior and physiology, this study sheds light on the physiological changes required to orchestrate adaptation to various temporal niches.",

Despite considerable efforts, the Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) is the only FDA-approved biomarker in melanoma. However, the mechanisms underlying TMB association with prolonged ICI survival are not entirely understood and may depend on numerous confounding factors. To identify more interpretable ICI response biomarkers based on tumor mutations, we train classifiers using mutations within distinct biological processes. We evaluate a variety of feature selection and classification methods and identify key mutated biological processes that provide improved predictive capability compared to the TMB. The top mutated processes we identify are leukocyte and T-cell proliferation regulation, which demonstrate stable predictive performance across different data cohorts of melanoma patients treated with ICI. This study provides biologically interpretable genomic predictors of ICI response with substantially improved predictive performance over the TMB.",

The purpose of our study was to integrate multidimensional data using a machine learning method to predict the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. We retrospectively enrolled 112 patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC receiving ICIs monotherapy. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to establish efficacy prediction models based on five different input datasets, including precontrast computed tomography (CT) radiomic data, postcontrast CT radiomic data, a combination of the two CT radiomic data, clinical data, and a combination of radiomic and clinical data. The 5-fold cross-validation was used to train and test the random forest classifier. The performance of the models was assessed according to the area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic curve. Survival analysis was performed to determine the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups with the prediction label generated by the combined model. The radiomic model based on the combination of precontrast and postcontrast CT radiomic features and the clinical model produced an AUC of 0.92\u00b10.04 and 0.89\u00b10.03, respectively. By integrating radiomic and clinical features together, the combined model had the best performance with an AUC of 0.94\u00b10.02. The survival analysis showed that the two groups had significantly different PFS times (p<0.0001). The baseline multidimensional data including CT radiomic and multiple clinical features were valuable in predicting the efficacy of ICIs monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.",

Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery<sup>3</sup> were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a\u00a0pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87.

    "synopsis": "Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where genomic alterations, protein expression deregulation, signaling pathway alterations, hormone disruption, ethnicity and environmental determinants are involved. Due to the complexity of BC, the prediction of proteins involved in this disease is a trending topic in drug design. This work is proposing accurate prediction classifier for BC proteins using six sets of protein sequence descriptors and 13 machine-learning methods. After using a univariate feature selection for the mix of five descriptor families, the best classifier was obtained using multilayer perceptron method (artificial neural network) and 300 features. The performance of the model is demonstrated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.980\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0037, and accuracy of 0.936\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0056 (3-fold cross-validation). Regarding the prediction of 4,504 cancer-associated proteins using this model, the best ranked cancer immunotherapy proteins related to BC were RPS27, SUPT4H1, CLPSL2, POLR2K, RPL38, AKT3, CDK3, RPS20, RASL11A and UBTD1; the best ranked metastasis driver proteins related to BC were S100A9, DDA1, TXN, PRNP, RPS27, S100A14, S100A7, MAPK1, AGR3 and NDUFA13; and the best ranked RNA-binding proteins related to BC were S100A9, TXN, RPS27L, RPS27, RPS27A, RPL38, MRPL54, PPAN, RPS20 and CSRP1. This powerful model predicts several BC-related proteins that should be deeply studied to find new biomarkers and better therapeutic targets.

To identify components of Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (JAK2/STAT5) signal transduction that contribute to the graded population response, we extended a cell-population-level model calibrated with experimental data to study the behavior in single cells. The single-cell model shows that the high cell-to-cell variability in nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 is caused by variability in the amount of Epo receptor (EpoR):JAK2 complexes and of SHP1, as well as the extent of nuclear import because of the large variance in the cytoplasmic volume of CFU-E cells. 24-118 pSTAT5 molecules in the nucleus for 120\u00a0min are sufficient to ensure cell survival. Thus, variability in membrane-associated processes is sufficient to convert a switch-like behavior at the single-cell level to a graded population-level response.",

    "title": "Protein-Peptide Turnover Profiling reveals the order of PTM addition and removal during protein maturation.",
    "synopsis": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate various aspects of protein function, including degradation. Mass spectrometric methods relying on pulsed metabolic labeling are popular to quantify turnover rates on a proteome-wide scale. Such data have traditionally been interpreted in the context of protein proteolytic stability. Here, we combine theoretical kinetic modeling with experimental pulsed stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC) for the study of protein phosphorylation. We demonstrate that metabolic labeling combined with PTM-specific enrichment does not measure effects of PTMs on protein stability. Rather, it reveals the relative order of PTM addition and removal along a protein's lifetime-a fundamentally different metric. This is due to interconversion of the measured proteoform species. Using this framework, we identify temporal phosphorylation sites on cell cycle-specific factors and protein complex assembly intermediates. Our results thus allow tying PTMs to the age of the modified proteins.",

    "synopsis": "Modeling biochemical reactions by means of differential equations often results in systems with a large number of variables and parameters. As this might complicate the interpretation and generalization of the obtained results, it is often desirable to reduce the complexity of the model. One way to accomplish this is by replacing the detailed reaction mechanisms of certain modules in the model by a mathematical expression that qualitatively describes the dynamical behavior of these modules. Such an approach has been widely adopted for ultrasensitive responses, for which underlying reaction mechanisms are often replaced by a single Hill function. Also time delays are usually accounted for by using an explicit delay in delay differential equations. In contrast, however, S-shaped response curves, which by definition have multiple output values for certain input values and are often encountered in bistable systems, are not easily modeled in such an explicit way. Here, we extend the classical Hill function into a mathematical expression that can be used to describe both ultrasensitive and S-shaped responses. We show how three ubiquitous modules (ultrasensitive responses, S-shaped responses and time delays) can be combined in different configurations and explore the dynamics of these systems. As an example, we apply our strategy to set up a model of the cell cycle consisting of multiple bistable switches, which can incorporate events such as DNA damage and coupling to the circadian clock in a phenomenological way.",
